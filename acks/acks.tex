\dropcap{T}his thesis would not exist without the people who made these past years not only possible, but truly enjoyable.

First and foremost, I thank my supervisors---Rampal, Luis, and Koen. You gave me the freedom to explore, the structure to finish, and the calm reassurance to keep going when things became messy. I have learned a great deal from your clarity, standards, and generosity. Just as importantly, I am grateful that along the way you became not only my mentors, but also friends for life.

To my parents, thank you for your steady faith and encouragement, even from far away. To my wife, thank you for being my anchor---for the warmth, patience, and quiet strength that carried me through the long stretches. To my family and friends, thank you for the laughter, the check-ins, the distractions at the right moments, and for reminding me that there is a world beyond revision cycles.

I am also grateful to my colleagues at the University of Groningen and Wageningen University \& Research for the welcoming atmosphere, thoughtful conversations, and the coffee breaks that somehow turned into ideas. Working with you made research feel far less like a solitary marathon.

Finally, a special thank-you to Mitou {\color{rug-red}\faCat}, our cat, and to all the other cats who contributed in their own way---by keeping me company, insisting on timely breaks, and maintaining the firm belief that keyboards are simply deluxe pillows.
