This repository contains the complete LaTeX source, figures, and supporting files for my PhD thesis.

> **Setup note:** This project is intended to be compiled on **Overleaf** (the source works as-is there).

---

## Download the compiled PDF

- **Latest release page:** https://github.com/EvoLandEco/Thesis/releases/latest

---

## Supplementary materials

Additional files that are too large or too numerous for the main thesis repository (e.g., supplementary figures, animations, and supporting materials) are maintained in the companion repository:

- **EvoLandEco/Thesis-Appendix:** https://github.com/EvoLandEco/Thesis-Appendix/

---

## Use on Overleaf

### Option A: Upload a ZIP
1. Click **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub.
2. In Overleaf, create a new project and **Upload Project** (ZIP).
3. Set the **Main file** to `dissertation.tex`.

### Option B: GitHub–Overleaf sync
If you use Overleaf’s GitHub integration, link this repository to your Overleaf project and keep the repo as the single source of truth.
