## Use on Overleaf

### Option A: Upload a ZIP
1. Click **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub.
2. In Overleaf, create a new project and **Upload Project** (ZIP).
3. Set the **Main file** to `dissertation.tex`.

### Option B: GitHub–Overleaf sync
If you use Overleaf’s GitHub integration, link this repository to your Overleaf project and keep the repo as the single source of truth.
