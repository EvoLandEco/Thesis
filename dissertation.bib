	abstract = {Despite considerable efforts devoted to investigate the community assembly processes driving plant invasions, few general conclusions have been drawn so far. Three main processes, generally acting as successive filters, are thought to be of prime importance. The invader has to disperse (1st filter) into a suitable environment (2nd filter) and succeed in establishing in recipient communities through competitive interactions (3rd filter) using two strategies: competition avoidance by the use of different resources (resource opportunity), or competitive exclusion of native species. Surprisingly, despite the general consensus on the importance of investigating these three processes and their interplay, they are usually studied independently., Here we aim to analyse these three filters together, by including them all: abiotic environment, dispersal and biotic interactions, into models of invasive species distributions. We first propose a suite of indices (based on species functional dissimilarities) supposed to reflect the two competitive strategies (resource opportunity and competition exclusion). Then, we use a set of generalised linear models to explain the distribution of seven herbaceous invaders in natural communities (using a large vegetation database for the French Alps containing 5,000 community-plots). Finally, we measure the relative importance of competitive interaction indices, identify the type of coexistence mechanism involved and how this varies along environmental gradients., Adding competition indices significantly improved model’s performance, but neither resource opportunity nor competitive exclusion were common strategies among the seven species. Overall, we show that combining environmental, dispersal and biotic information to model invasions has excellent potential for improving our understanding of invader success.},

	abstract = {Darwin proposed two seemingly contradictory hypotheses regarding factors influencing the outcome of biological invasions. He initially posited that nonnative species closely related to native species would be more likely to successfully establish, because they might share adaptations to the local environment (preadaptation hypothesis). However, based on observations that the majority of naturalized plant species in the United States belonged to nonnative genera, he concluded that the lack of competitive exclusion would facilitate the establishment of alien invaders phylogenetically distinct from the native flora (competition-relatedness hypothesis). To date, no consensus has been reached regarding these opposing hypotheses. Here, following Darwin, we use the flora of the United States to examine patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic relatedness between native and nonnative taxa across thousands of nested locations ranging in size and extent, from local to regional scales. We find that the probability of observing the signature of environmental filtering over that of competition increases with spatial scale. Further, native and nonnative species tended to be less related in warm, humid environments. Our work provides an empirical assessment of the role of observation scale and climate in biological invasions and demonstrates that Darwin’s two opposing hypotheses need not be mutually exclusive.},

	abstract = {Darwin's naturalization hypothesis (DNH), which predicts that alien species more distantly related to native communities are more likely to naturalize, has received much recent attention. The mixed findings from empirical studies that have tested DNH, however, seem to defy generalizations. Using meta-analysis to synthesize results of existing studies, we show that the predictive power of DNH depends on both the invasion stage and the spatial scale of the studies. Alien species more closely related to natives tended to be less successful at the local scale, supporting DNH; invasion success, however, was unaffected by alien–native relatedness at the regional scale. On the other hand, alien species with stronger impacts on native communities tended to be more closely related to natives at the local scale, but less closely related to natives at the regional scale. These patterns are generally consistent across different ecosystems, taxa and investigation methods. Our results revealed the different effects of invader–native relatedness on invader success and impact, suggesting the operation of different mechanisms across invasion stages and spatial scales.},

Birth-death models inferring the impact of these factors typically assume monotonic relationships between single predictors and rates, limiting our ability to assess more complex effects and their relative importance and interaction. We introduce a Bayesian birth-death model using unsupervised neural networks to explore multifactorial and nonlinear effects on speciation and extinction rates using fossil data. It infers lineage- and time-specific rates and disentangles predictor effects and importance through explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Analysis of the proboscidean fossil record revealed speciation rates shaped by dietary flexibility and biogeographic events. The emergence of modern humans escalated extinction rates, causing recent diversity decline, while regional climate had a lesser impact. Our model paves the way for an improved understanding of the intricate dynamics shaping clade diversification.

	abstract = {Reticulate evolution has long been recognized as a key mechanism that contributes to genetic and trait diversity. With the widespread availability of genomic data, investigating historical reticulate evolution across taxa has gained significant attention, driven by the rapid development of statistical methods for detecting nontreelike patterns. Phylogenetic networks provide a biologically intuitive approach to depicting evolutionary processes such as hybrid speciation and introgressive hybridization, which result in signatures of historical gene flow. Interpreting phylogenetic networks is especially critical for groups of conservation concern that lack reference genome resources and explicit hypotheses from prior investigation, such as those based on molecular data, morphology, or species distributions. Here, we highlight recent advances in computational methods for inferring networks from genome-scale data and offer guidelines for deriving biological insights from phylogenetic networks. Particular emphasis is placed on modeling hybridization and whole-genome duplication in the context of allopolyploidization. Practical recommendations for empirical studies and the limitations of commonly used methods are discussed throughout. We anticipate that phylogenetic networks will influence conservation biology and biodiversity research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of reticulate evolution inferred from these networks in the near future. Networks will accelerate other pressing avenues of biodiversity research, especially investigations of orphan crops and climate change resilience in natural systems. The promise of phylogenetic networks connects with broader themes in the special feature Monitoring and restoring gene flow in the increasingly fragmented ecosystems of the Anthropocene by providing an emerging probabilistic framework for inferring historical connectivity between species and populations.},

                  Using phylogenies of present‐day species to estimate diversification rate trajectories—speciation and extinction rates over time—is a challenging task due to non‐identifiability issues. Given a phylogeny, there exists an infinite set of trajectories that result in the same likelihood; this set has been coined a congruence class. Previous work has developed approaches for sampling trajectories within a given congruence class, with the aim to assess the extent to which congruent scenarios can vary from one another. Based on this sampling approach, it has been suggested that rapid changes in speciation or extinction rates are conserved across the class. Reaching such conclusions requires to sample the broadest possible set of distinct trajectories.
                
                
                  We introduce a new method for exploring congruence classes that we implement in the R package CRABS. Whereas existing methods constrain either the speciation rate or the extinction rate trajectory, ours provides more flexibility by sampling congruent speciation and extinction rate trajectories simultaneously. This allows covering a more representative set of distinct diversification rate trajectories. We also implement a filtering step that allows selecting the most parsimonious trajectories within a class.
                
                
                  We demonstrate the utility of our new sampling strategy using a simulated scenario. Next, we apply our approach to the study of mammalian diversification history. We show that rapid changes in speciation and extinction rates need not be conserved across a congruence class, but that selecting the most parsimonious trajectories shrinks the class to concordant scenarios.
                
                
                  Our approach opens new avenues both to truly explore the myriad of potential diversification histories consistent with a given phylogeny, embracing the uncertainty inherent to phylogenetic diversification models, and to select among these different histories. This should help refining our inference of diversification trajectories from extant data.},

                  Diversification rates inferred from phylogenies are not identifiable if the rates are allowed to vary freely over time. There are infinitely many combinations of speciation and extinction rate functions that have the exact same likelihood score for a given phylogeny, building a congruence class. The specific shape and characteristics of such congruence classes have not yet been studied. Whether speciation and extinction rate functions within a congruence class share common features is also not known.
                
                
                  Prior hypotheses typically render diversification rates identifiable, but the results then depend on these a priori hypotheses and assumptions. To test the robustness of diversification results to these a priori hypotheses, we use two different approaches to explore congruence classes: (i) constructing congruent models under alternative hypotheses and (ii) sampling alternative rate function within the congruence class.
                
                
                  
                    Our methods are implemented in the open‐source R package
                    CRABS
                    (
                    https://github.com/afmagee/CRABS
                    ).
                    CRABS
                    provides a flexible approach to explore the congruence class and provides summaries of rate functions within a congruence class. The summaries can highlight common trends, that is, increasing, flat or decreasing rates.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Although there are infinitely many equally likely diversification rate functions, these can share common features.
                    CRABS
                    can be used to assess if diversification rate patterns are robust despite the non‐identifiability of the birth
                    –
                    death model. In our example, we clearly identify three phases of diversification rate changes that are common among all models which we sampled from the congruence class. Thus, congruence classes are not necessarily a problem for studying historical patterns of biodiversity from phylogenies.},

	abstract = {In a striking result, Louca and Pennell [S. Louca, M. W. Pennell, Nature 580, 502–505 (2020)] recently proved that a large class of phylogenetic birth–death models is statistically unidentifiable from lineage-through-time (LTT) data: Any pair of sufficiently smooth birth and death rate functions is “congruent” to an infinite collection of other rate functions, all of which have the same likelihood for any LTT vector of any dimension. As Louca and Pennell argue, this fact has distressing implications for the thousands of studies that have utilized birth–death models to study evolution. In this paper, we qualify their finding by proving that an alternative and widely used class of birth–death models is indeed identifiable. Specifically, we show that piecewise constant birth–death models can, in principle, be consistently estimated and distinguished from one another, given a sufficiently large extant timetree and some knowledge of the present-day population. Subject to mild regularity conditions, we further show that any unidentifiable birth–death model class can be arbitrarily closely approximated by a class of identifiable models. The sampling requirements needed for our results to hold are explicit and are expected to be satisfied in many contexts such as the phylodynamic analysis of a global pandemic.},

	abstract = {Estimation of parameters of evolutionary island biogeography models, such as colonization and diversification rates, is important for a better understanding of island systems. A popular statistical inference framework is likelihood-based estimation of parameters using island species richness and phylogenetic data. Likelihood approaches require that the likelihood can be computed analytically or numerically, but with the increasing complexity of island biogeography models, this is often unfeasible. Simulation-based estimation methods may then be a promising alternative. One such method is approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which compares summary statistics of the empirical data with the output of model simulations. However, ABC demands the definition of summary statistics that sufficiently describe the data, which is yet to be explored in island biogeography. Here, we propose a set of summary statistics and use it in an ABC framework for the estimation of parameters of an island biogeography model, DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Island biota through Speciation, Immigration and Extinction). For this model, likelihood-based inference is possible, which gives us the opportunity to assess the performance of the summary statistics. DAISIE currently only allows maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), so we additionally develop a likelihood-based Bayesian inference framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to enable comparison with the ABC results (i.e., making the same assumptions on prior distributions). We simulated phylogenies of island communities subject to colonization, speciation, and extinction using the DAISIE simulation model and compared the estimated parameters using the three inference approaches (MLE, MCMC and ABC). Our results show that the ABC algorithm performs well in estimating colonization and diversification rates, except when the species richness or amount of phylogenetic information from an island are low. We find that compared to island species diversity statistics, summary statistics that make use of phylogenetic and temporal patterns (e.g., the number of species through time) significantly improve ABC inference accuracy, especially in estimating colonization and anagenesis rates, as well as making inference converge considerably faster and perform better under the same number of iterations. Island biogeography is rapidly developing new simulation models that can explain the complexity of island biodiversity, and our study provides a set of informative summary statistics that can be used in island biogeography studies for which likelihood-based inference methods are not an option.},

	abstract = {Black-box machine learning models are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Conformal prediction is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90\%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed to provide the reader a working understanding of conformal prediction and related distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques with one self-contained document. We lead the reader through practical theory for and examples of conformal prediction and describe its extensions to complex machine learning tasks involving structured outputs, distribution shift, time-series, outliers, models that abstain, and more. Throughout, there are many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python. With each code sample comes a Jupyter notebook implementing the method on a real-data example; the notebooks can be accessed and easily run using our codebase.},

              1.
               The R package ‘diversitree’ contains a number of classical and contemporary comparative phylogenetic methods. Key included methods are BiSSE (binary state speciation and extinction), MuSSE (a multistate extension of BiSSE), and QuaSSE (quantitative state speciation and extinction). Diversitree also includes methods for analysing trait evolution and estimating speciation/extinction rates independently.
            
            
              2.
               In this note, I describe the features and demonstrate use of the package, using a new method, MuSSE (multistate speciation and extinction), to examine the joint effects of two traits on speciation.
            
            
              3.
               Using simulations, I found that MuSSE could reliably detect that a binary trait that affected speciation rates when simultaneously accounting for additional thats that had no effect on speciation rates.

	abstract = {Until recently, rigorously reconstructing the many hybrid speciation events in plants has not been practical because of the limited number of molecular markers available for plant phylogenetic reconstruction and the lack of good, biologically based methods for inferring reticulation (network) events. This situation should change rapidly with the development of multiple nuclear markers for phylogenetic reconstruction and new methods for reconstructing reticulate evolution. These developments will necessitate a much greater incorporation of population genetics into phylogenetic reconstruction than has been common. Population genetic events such as gene duplication coupled with lineage sorting and meiotic and sexual recombination have always had the potential to affect phylogenetic inference. For tree reconstruction, these problems are usually minimized by using uniparental markers and nuclear markers that undergo rapid concerted evolution. Because reconstruction of reticulate speciation events will require nuclear markers that lack these characteristics, effects of population genetics on phylogenetic inference will need to be addressed directly. Current models and methods that allow hybrid speciation to be detected and reconstructed are discussed, with a focus on how lineage sorting and meiotic and sexual recombination affect network reconstruction. Approaches that would allow inference of phylogenetic networks in their presence are suggested.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Divergence time estimation on an absolute timescale requires external calibration information, which typically is derived from the fossil record. The common practice in Bayesian divergence time estimation involves applying calibration densities to individual nodes. Often, these priors are arbitrarily chosen and specified yet have an excessive impact on estimates of absolute time. We introduce the fossilized birth–death process—a fossil calibration method that unifies extinct and extant species with a single macroevolutionary model, eliminating the need for ad hoc calibration priors. Compared with common calibration density approaches, Bayesian inference under this mechanistic model yields more accurate node age estimates while providing a coherent measure of statistical uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike calibration densities, our model accommodates all the reliable fossils for a given phylogenetic dataset.
          , 
            
              Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data—most commonly, fossil age estimates—are required to calibrate estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence time methods, the common practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of the information in the fossil record. We introduce the “fossilized birth–death” (FBD) process—a model for calibrating divergence time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and show that node age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and accurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence time estimation methods. We used this model to estimate the speciation times for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus
              Ursus
              diversified in the Late Miocene to Middle Pliocene.},

              Algorithms to reconstruct character evolution on polytomous cladograms or phylogenetic trees have to date interpreted each polytomy literally, as if it were an event of multiple speciation, with multiple daughter species descending independently from a mother species, thus requiring any similarities shared by only some of these daughters to be accounted for by convergence. These algorithms are not appropriate when the polytomy is interpreted in the usual way, namely as representing uncertainty in the cladogram's resolution. New algorithms for both ordered and unordered characters are presented to reconstruct character evolution under the uncertain‐resolution interpretation of polytomies. These algorithms allow the cladogram to resolve itself so as to be favourable for the character whose evolution is being reconstructed. Because different characters may have different favourable resolutions, it is not possible in general to use these algorithms to determine the total parsimony of a polytomous cladogram (the number of evolutionary steps required over all characters by the cladogram), for which the only adequate approach is to find a most parsimonious dichotomous resolution of the cladogram.},

	abstract = {Energy distance is a metric that measures the distance between the distributions of random vectors. Energy distance is zero if and only if the distributions are identical, thus it characterizes equality of distributions and provides a theoretical foundation for statistical inference and analysis. Energy statistics are functions of distances between observations in metric spaces. As a statistic, energy distance can be applied to measure the difference between a sample and a hypothesized distribution or the difference between two or more samples in arbitrary, not necessarily equal dimensions. The name energy is inspired by the close analogy with Newton's gravitational potential energy. Applications include testing independence by distance covariance, goodness‐of‐fit, nonparametric tests for equality of distributions and extension of analysis of variance, generalizations of clustering algorithms, change point analysis, feature selection, and more.

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models are a flexible class of models that can be used to describe time series data which depends on an unobservable Markov process. As with any complex model, it is not always obvious whether all the parameters are identifiable, or if the model is parameter redundant; that is, the model can be reparameterised in terms of a smaller number of parameters. This paper considers different methods for detecting parameter redundancy and identifiability in hidden Markov models. We examine both numerical methods and methods that involve symbolic algebra. These symbolic methods require a unique representation of a model, known as an exhaustive summary. We provide an exhaustive summary for hidden Markov models and show how it can be used to investigate identifiability.},

	abstract = {With the increasing availability of genomic data, biologists aim to find more accurate descriptions of evolutionary histories influenced by secondary contact, where diverging lineages reconnect before diverging again. Such reticulate evolutionary events can be more accurately represented in phylogenetic networks than in phylogenetic trees. Since the root location of phylogenetic networks cannot be inferred from biological data under several evolutionary models, we consider semi-directed (phylogenetic) networks: partially directed graphs without a root in which the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. By specifying a known outgroup, the rooted topology can be recovered from such networks. We introduce the algorithm Squirrel (Semi-directed Quarnet-based Inference to Reconstruct Level-1 Networks) which constructs a semi-directed level-1 network from a full set of quarnets (four-leaf semi-directed networks). Our method also includes a heuristic to construct such a quarnet set directly from sequence alignments. We demonstrate Squirrel’s performance through simulations and on real sequence data sets, the largest of which contains 29 aligned sequences close to 1.7 Mb long. The resulting networks are obtained on a standard laptop within a few minutes. Lastly, we prove that Squirrel is combinatorially consistent: given a full set of quarnets coming from a triangle-free semi-directed level-1 network, it is guaranteed to reconstruct the original network. Squirrel is implemented in Python, has an easy-to-use graphical user interface that takes sequence alignments or quarnets as input, and is freely available at https://github.com/nholtgrefe/squirrel.},

	abstract = {A core goal of phylogenomics is to determine the evolutionary history of a set of species from biological sequence data. Phylogenetic networks are able to describe more complex evolutionary phenomena than phylogenetic trees but are more difficult to accurately reconstruct. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing methods to infer semi-directed phylogenetic networks. As computing such networks can be computationally intensive, one approach to building such networks is to puzzle together smaller networks. Thus, it is essential to have robust methods for inferring semi-directed phylogenetic networks on small numbers of taxa. In this paper, we investigate an algebraic method for performing phylogenetic network inference from nucleotide sequence data on 4-leaf semi-directed phylogenetic networks by analysing the distribution of leaf-pattern probabilities. On simulated data, we found that we can correctly identify with high accuracy the undirected phylogenetic network for sequences of length at least 10kbp. We found that identifying the semi-directed network is more challenging and requires sequences of length approaching 10Mbp. We are also able to use our approach to identify tree-like evolution and determine the underlying tree. Finally, we employ our method on a real dataset from Xiphophorus species and use the results to build a phylogenetic network.},

Given a network, almost all of them partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile. However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local variational techniques.

	abstract = {The dynamical process of epidemic spreading has drawn much attention of the complex network community. In the network paradigm, diseases spread from one person to another through the social ties amongst the population. There are a variety of factors that govern the processes of disease spreading on the networks. A common but not negligible factor is people’s reaction to the outbreak of epidemics. Such reaction can be related information dissemination or self-protection. In this work, we explore the interactions between disease spreading and population response in terms of information diffusion and individuals’ alertness. We model the system by mapping multiplex networks into two-layer networks and incorporating individuals’ risk awareness, on the assumption that their response to the disease spreading depends on the size of the community they belong to. By comparing the final incidence of diseases in multiplex networks, we find that there is considerable mitigation of diseases spreading for full phase of spreading speed when individuals’ protection responses are introduced. Interestingly, the degree of community overlap between the two layers is found to be critical factor that affects the final incidence. We also analyze the consequences of the epidemic incidence in communities with different sizes and the impacts of community overlap between two layers. Specifically, as the diseases information makes individuals alert and take measures to prevent the diseases, the effective protection is more striking in small community. These phenomena can be explained by the multiplexity of the networked system and the competition between two spreading processes.},

The theoretical analysis of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous networks requires the development of novel analytical frameworks, and it has produced results of conceptual and practical relevance. A coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes is presented, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, computer, and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while focusing on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes are also presented. Finally, the research activity at the forefront in the study of epidemic spreading in coevolving, coupled, and time-varying networks is reported.},

Popular approaches, including the stochastic block model (SBM), assume edges are unweighted, which limits their utility by discarding potentially useful information. We introduce the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM), which generalizes the SBM to networks with edge weights drawn from any exponential family distribution. This model learns from both the presence and weight of edges, allowing it to discover structure that would otherwise be hidden when weights are discarded or thresholded. We describe a Bayesian variational algorithm for efficiently approximating this model's posterior distribution over latent block structures. We then evaluate the WSBM's performance on both edge-existence and edge-weight prediction tasks for a set of real-world weighted networks. In all cases, the WSBM performs as well or better than the best alternatives on these tasks.},

ICVIs are required to certify the apparent health of cattle moving across state borders and allow us to examine cattle movements at the county scale. The majority of the ICVI sample consisted of small shipments ({\textless}20 head) moved for feeding and beef production. Geographically, the central plains states had the most connections, correlated to feeding infrastructure. The entire nation was closely connected when interstate movements were summarized at the state level. At the county-level, the U.S. is still well connected geographically, but significant heterogeneities in the location and identity of counties central to the network emerge. Overall, the network of interstate movements is described by a hub structure, with a few counties sending or receiving extremely large numbers of shipments and many counties sending and receiving few shipments. The county-level network also has a very low proportion of reciprocal movements, indicating that high-order network properties may be better at describing a county's importance than simple summaries of the number of shipments or animals sent and received. We suggest that summarizing cattle movements at the state level homogenizes the network and a county level approach is most appropriate for examining processes influenced by cattle shipments, such as economic analyses and disease outbreaks.},

Using animal movement data from the British cattle industry as an example, this analysis explores whether disease dynamics can be altered by placing targeted restrictions on contact formation to reconfigure network topology. This was accomplished using a simple network generation algorithm that combined configuration wiring with stochastic block modelling techniques to preserve the weighted in- and out-degree of individual nodes (farms) as well as key demographic characteristics of the individual network connections (movement date, livestock market, and animal production type). We then tested a control strategy based on introducing additional constraints into the network generation algorithm to prevent farms with a high in-degree from selling cattle to farms with a high out-degree as these particular network connections are predicted to have a disproportionately strong role in spreading disease. Results from simple dynamic disease simulation models predicted significantly lower endemic disease prevalences on the trade restricted networks compared to the baseline generated networks. As expected, the relative magnitude of the predicted changes in endemic prevalence was greater for diseases with short infectious periods and low transmission probabilities. Overall, our study findings demonstrate that there is significant potential for controlling multiple infectious diseases simultaneously by manipulating networks to have more epidemiologically favourable topological configurations. Further research is needed to determine whether the economic and social benefits of controlling disease can justify the costs of restricting contact formation.},

Our approach, motivated by the importance of controlling for label switching issues across the different time steps, focuses on detecting groups characterized by a stable within-group connectivity behaviour. We study identifiability of the model parameters and propose an inference procedure based on a variational expectation–maximization algorithm as well as a model selection criterion to select the number of groups. We carefully discuss our initialization strategy which plays an important role in the method and we compare our procedure with existing procedures on synthetic data sets.

Livestock disease spread models, such as those for the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the United Kingdom, represent some of the best case studies of large-scale disease spread. However, generalization of these models to explore disease outcomes in other systems, such as the United States’s cattle industry, has been hampered by differences in system size and complexity and the absence of suitable livestock movement data. Here, a unique database of US cattle shipments allows estimation of synthetic movement networks that inform a near-continental scale disease model of a potential FMD-like (i.e., rapidly spreading) epidemic in US cattle. The largest epidemics may affect over one-third of the US and 120,000 cattle premises, but cattle movement restrictions from infected counties, as opposed to national movement moratoriums, are found to effectively contain outbreaks. Slow detection or weak compliance may necessitate more severe state-level bans for similar control. Such results highlight the role of large-scale disease models in emergency preparedness, particularly for systems lacking comprehensive movement and outbreak data, and the need to rapidly implement multi-scale contingency plans during a potential US outbreak.},

	abstract = {More and more countries hold databases on cattle movements. The primary purpose of the registration of cattle movements is to provide data for quick tracing of contagious animals in case of disease outbreaks and food safety scares. Nevertheless, these data can also be used for analytical studies to get insight into the nature of the contact structure between and within cattle holding types. This paper focuses on the effect post-2001 FMD movement regulations have had on the number of cattle movements between different and within the same cattle holding types. Important characteristics and dynamics of cattle movement patterns of Dutch cattle holding types were identified using data on cattle movements after the 2001 FMD outbreak. The results showed that in 2001, just after the FMD outbreak when strict movement restriction regulations were in force, a reduced number of cattle movements was seen compared to before the FMD outbreak. However, the number of cattle movements off-farm for live trade and the number of imported cattle increased in the period 2002–2004 to higher levels than expected, i.e. to levels almost as high as before the FMD outbreak, despite operative movement restriction regulations. As the number of cattle movements to and from traders strongly decreased just after the FMD outbreak in 2001, traders regained their central role again in the network in the years 2002–2004. Quantifying the Dutch cattle contact structure between and within holding types up to 3.5 years after the FMD outbreak gave evidence that the post-FMD movement restriction regulations were not able to reduce the number of cattle movements in the longer term. With that the risk of a large epidemic increased. Quantifying contact structures based on animal movement data between different and within the same cattle holding types is important for targeting disease control and for assessing compliance with legislation.},

	abstract = {The spread of infectious livestock diseases is a major cause for concern in modern agricultural systems. In the dynamics of the transmission of such diseases, movements of livestock between herds play an important role. When constructing mathematical models used for activities such as forecasting epidemic development, evaluating mitigation strategies, or determining important targets for disease surveillance, including between-premises shipments is often a necessity. In the United States (U.S.), livestock shipment data is not routinely collected, and when it is, it is not readily available and mostly concerned with between-state shipments. To bridge this gap in knowledge and provide insight into the complete livestock shipment network structure, we have developed the U.S. Animal Movement Model (USAMM). Previously, USAMM has only existed for cattle shipments, but here we present a version for domestic swine. This new version of USAMM consists of a Bayesian model fit to premises demography, county-level livestock industry variables, and two limited data sets of between-state swine movements. The model scales up the data to simulate nation-wide networks of both within- and between-state shipments at the level of individual premises. Here we describe this shipment model in detail and subsequently explore its usefulness with a rudimentary predictive model of the prevalence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) across the U.S. Additionally, in order to promote further research on livestock disease and other topics involving the movements of swine in the U.S., we also make 250 synthetic premises-level swine shipment networks with complete coverage of the entire conterminous U.S. freely available to the research community as a useful surrogate for the absent shipment data.},

First, we use a probabilistic approach based on the maximum information entropy method to estimate the movement probabilities among different swine populations. Then, we create a swine movement network using the estimated probabilities for the counties of the central agricultural district of Iowa. The analysis of this network has found evidence of the small-world phenomenon.

	abstract = {The movements of livestock between premises and markets can be characterised as a dynamic network where the structure of the network itself can critically impact the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases. As evidenced by the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK, this can involve transmission over large geographical distances and can result in major economic loss. One consequence of the FMD epidemic was the introduction of mandatory livestock movement restrictions: a 13-day standstill in Scotland for cattle and sheep after moving livestock onto a farm (allowing many exemptions) and a 6-day standstill for cattle and sheep in England and Wales (with minor exemptions, e.g. direct movements to slaughter). Such standstills are known to be effective but commercial considerations result in pressures to relax them. When contemplating legislative changes such as a change in length of movement restrictions we need to consider the consequent effect these could have on the emergent properties of the system, i.e. the network structure itself. In this study, we investigate how disease dynamics change when the local contact structure of the recorded livestock movement network in Scotland is altered through rewiring movements between premises. The network rewiring used here changes the structure of the recorded trade network through a combination of altered movement restrictions and redirection of movements between holdings and markets to avoid nonsensical activity (e.g. movements to markets on days when they are inactive) while conserving other characteristics (e.g. movement date as closely as possible and market sales of the correct animal production type). Rewiring results in networks with higher clustering coefficients and lower network density. The impact of rewiring on a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Scotland was assessed by stochastic simulation, considering scenarios with and without exemptions to the standstill rules. As expected, rewiring leads to a decrease in outbreak size and - if standstill exemptions are prohibited – higher probability of smaller outbreaks. Without exemptions, a shorter movement standstill is almost as effective as a longer standstill period, indicating that a simpler biosecurity system would offer minimal additional risk for FMD. These results suggest that explicitly manipulating the contact network structure in a sensible way has the potential to significantly impact disease control.},

We find that high in-degree farm operations (i.e., markets) play critical roles in the disease spread. We also find that high in-degree based targeted isolation and hypothetical vaccinations are more effective for disease control compared to other centrality-based mitigation strategies.

The objective of this study was to develop a network based simulation model for the between-farm spread of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus to assess the impact of contact structure on between-farm transmission of PRRS virus. For these farm level models, a hypothetical population of 500 swine farms following a multistage production system was used. The contact rates between farms were based on a study analyzing movement of pigs in Canada, while disease spread parameters were extracted from published literature. Eighteen distinct scenarios were designed and simulated by varying the mode of transmission (direct versus direct and indirect contact), type of index herd (farrowing, nursery and finishing), and the presumed network structures among swine farms (random, scale-free and small-world). PRRS virus was seeded in a randomly selected farm and 500 iterations of each scenario were simulated for 52 weeks. The median epidemic size by the end of the simulated period and percentage die-out for each scenario, were the key outcomes captured. Scenarios with scale-free network models resulted in the largest epidemic sizes, while scenarios with random and small-world network models resulted in smaller and similar epidemic sizes. Similarly, stochastic die-out percentage was least for scenarios with scale-free networks followed by random and small-world networks. Findings of the study indicated that incorporating network structures among the swine farms had a considerable impact on the spread of PRRS virus, highlighting the importance of understanding and incorporating realistic contact structures when developing infectious disease spread models for similar populations.},

Despite an abundance of small-scale observational studies, the role of the poultry trade in disseminating AIV over large geographic areas is still unclear, especially for developing countries with complex poultry production systems. Here we combine virus genomes and reconstructed poultry transportation data to measure and compare the spatial spread in China of three key subtypes of AIV: H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. Although it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of confounding factors, such as bird migration and spatial distance, we find evidence that the dissemination of these subtypes among domestic poultry is geographically continuous and likely associated with the intensity of the live poultry trade in China. Using two independent data sources and network analysis methods, we report a regional-scale community structure in China that might explain the spread of AIV subtypes in the country. The identification of this structure has the potential to inform more targeted strategies for the prevention and control of AIV in China.},

	abstract = {Between-farm animal movement is one of the most important factors influencing the spread of infectious diseases in food animals, including in the US swine industry. Understanding the structural network of contacts in a food animal industry is prerequisite to planning for efficient production strategies and for effective disease control measures. Unfortunately, data regarding between farm animal movements in the US is not systematically collected and thus, such information is often unavailable. In this paper we develop a procedure to replicate the structure of a network, making use of partial data available, and subsequently use the model developed to predict animal movements among sites in 34 Minnesota counties. First, we summarized two partial networks of swine producing facilities in Minnesota, then we used a machine learning technique referred to as random forest (RF), an ensemble of independent classification trees, to estimate the probability of pig movements between farms and/or markets sites located in two counties in Minnesota. The model was calibrated and tested by comparing predicted to observed data in those two counties for which data were available. Finally, the model was used to predict animal movements in sites located across 34 Minnesota counties. Variables that were important in predicting pig movements included between-site distance, ownership, and production type of the sending and receiving farms and/or markets. Using a weighted-kernel approach to describe spatial variation in the centrality measures of the predicted network we showed that the south-central region of the study area exhibited high aggregation of predicted pig movements. Our results show an overlap with the distribution of outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is believed to be transmitted, at least in part, though animal movements. While the correspondence of movements and disease is not a causal test; it suggests that the predicted network may approximate actual movements. Accordingly, the predictions provided here might help to design and implement control strategies in the region. Additionally, the methodology here may be used to estimate contact networks for other livestock systems when only incomplete information regarding animal movements is available.},

	abstract = {Modern beef cattle production in the U.S. is a highly specialized system that spans from cow–calf ranches, to stockers, to feedlots, to packers. The cattle production system is particularly interdependent with the transportation system, as cattle and feed need to be moved through production phases. Although this interdependence enables the economic functioning of the interdependent system, it also brings vulnerabilities to the system amplifying disease spreading and natural disaster consequences. Taking southwest Kansas as a study area, we explicitly model the beef cattle industry and the transportation industry as two independent but interconnected industries through agent-based modeling. Since cattle and truck movement data are scarce due to privacy concerns, we first generate cattle and truck movement data among production locations under normal operating conditions. We then assess the system robustness by constructing hypothetical disruptions in the cattle industry and in the transportation industry. The simulation results show that the interdependent system is robust to random failures but vulnerable to the targeted shutdown of cattle premises or truck premises. In addition, we observe that disruptions in the trucks serving packers have the worst impact on cattle production, as compared to other transportation disruptions. In disaster preparations, policymakers and system designers need to consider vulnerabilities caused by the interdependent infrastructure and pay particular attention to one of its critical components, meat packers.},

Contact networks of cattle are generated by geographical proximity and disease is spread through a simple compartmental model on the dynamic contact structures. An analysis of the network metrics of the contact networks and the aggregated contact networks provides insight into the influence of the network dynamics on the epidemic dynamics. Using farm data based on the Kansas cattle industry, our experiments show a tri-modal distribution of total case counts that becomes bi-modal for weaker diseases. These results are explained by the interaction of the disease and trading processes. We show how simple network metrics, such as the average node degree, can track the complex trading processes which shape the evolution of the disease at an agent level.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to use exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to explain networks of movement of backyard chickens in provinces which had been hotspots for avian influenza outbreaks in Thailand during 2004–2005. We used structured questionnaires to collect data for the period January to December 2009 from participants who were involved in the backyard chicken farming network in three avian influenza hotspots (Ratchaburi, Suphan Buri, and Nakhon Pathom provinces) in Thailand. From 557 questionnaires, we identified nodes, points of entry and exit from nodes, and activities relating to backyard chicken farming and movement of chickens, and generated ERGMs based on non-festive periods (Model 1) and the Chinese New Year period (Model 2). In Model 1, k-star (the central node is connected to k other nodes) connections were predominant (P {\textless}  0.001). In Model 2, the frequency of movement increased by 10.62 times, k-star connections were still predominant (P {\textless}  0.001), and the model was scale-free. Hubs were formed from owners/observers in the arenas/training fields, farmers who raised chickens for consumption only, and traders. In conclusion, our models indicated that, if avian influenza was introduced during non-festive periods, the authorities would need to regularly restrict the movement of chickens. However, during high-frequency periods of movement of backyard chickens, authorities would also need to focus on the network hubs. Our research can be used by the relevant authorities to improve control measures and reduce the risk or lessen the magnitude of disease spread during an avian influenza epidemic.},

A better understanding of the pig trade dynamics can inform the implementation of risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control programs for swine diseases. In this study, a semi-structured questionnaire elaborated by FAO and implemented to 487 farmers was used to collect data regarding basic characteristics about pig demographics and live-pig trade among villages in the country of Georgia, where very scarce information is available. Social network analysis and exponential random graph models were used to better understand the structure, contact patterns and main drivers for pig trade in the country. Results indicate relatively infrequent (a total of 599 shipments in one year) and geographically localized (median Euclidean distance between shipments = 6.08 km; IQR = 0–13.88 km) pig movements in the studied regions. The main factors contributing to live-pig trade movements among villages were being from the same region (i.e., local trade), usage of a middleman or a live animal market to trade live pigs by at least one farmer in the village, and having a large number of pig farmers in the village. The identified villages’ characteristics and structural network properties could be used to inform the design of more cost-effective surveillance systems in a country which pig industry was recently devastated by African swine fever epidemics and where backyard production systems are predominant.},

	abstract = {Animal movements are typically driven by areas of supply and demand for animal products and by the seasonality of production and demand. As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aïd el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.},

	abstract = {The continuous threat of foreign animal disease (FAD) is real and present for the U.S. swine industry. Because of this, the industry has developed plans to ensure business continuity during a FAD outbreak. A core aspect of these plans is regional standstill orders of swine movements to prevent disease spread following a FAD introduction. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information about the impact of such practices on animal movements throughout the remaining swine marketing channel. This study utilizes a simplified gravity model, to understand the effects of standstill orders on individual states. The effect of each closure on the established trade patterns is determined by monitoring changes in a PPML regression coefficients of the model. Model validation compared the predicted impact of the closure of a terminal processing facility against a real-life closure dataset collected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The analysis determined that both the population size and location of the closure affected the observed trade patterns. These findings suggest that using a regional stop movement order may complicate disease introduction preparation as each policy comes with its own potential outcome, shifting the geospatial distribution of area risk posed by these cull populations.},

Networks, which explicitly included six different patterns of connection between vertices, were created. Both scale-free networks and random graphs showed a different response in path level to increasing levels of clustering than regular lattices. Clustering promoted short path lengths in all network types, but randomly assembled networks displayed a logarithmic relationship between degree and path length; whereas this response was linear in regular lattices. In all cases, small-world models, generated by rewiring the connections of a regular lattice, displayed properties, which spanned the gap between random and regular networks. Simulation of a disease in these networks showed a strong response to connectance pattern, even when the number of edges and vertices were approximately equal. Epidemic spread was fastest, and reached the largest size, in scale-free networks, then in random graphs. Regular lattices were the slowest to be infected, and rewired lattices were intermediate between these two extremes. Scale-free networks displayed the capacity to produce an epidemic even at a likelihood of infection, which was too low to produce an epidemic for the other network types. The interaction between the statistical properties of the network and the results of epidemic spread provides a useful tool for assessing the risk of disease spread in more realistic networks.},

	abstract = {Contact network epidemiology is an approach to modeling the spread of infectious diseases that explicitly considers patterns of person-to-person contacts within a community. Contacts can be asymmetric, with a person more likely to infect one of their contacts than to become infected by that contact. This is true for some sexually transmitted diseases that are more easily caught by women than men during heterosexual encounters; and for severe infectious diseases that cause an average person to seek medical attention and thereby potentially infect health care workers (HCWs) who would not, in turn, have an opportunity to infect that average person. Here we use methods from percolation theory to develop a mathematical framework for predicting disease transmission through semi-directed contact networks in which some contacts are undirected—the probability of transmission is symmetric between individuals—and others are directed—transmission is possible only in one direction. We find that the probability of an epidemic and the expected fraction of a population infected during an epidemic can be different in semi-directed networks, in contrast to the routine assumption that these two quantities are equal. We furthermore demonstrate that these methods more accurately predict the vulnerability of HCWs and the efficacy of various hospital-based containment strategies during outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases.},

	abstract = {The use of social and contact networks to answer basic and applied questions about infectious disease transmission in wildlife and livestock is receiving increased attention. Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools.},

	abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is endemic in Asia, with live bird trade as a major disease transmission pathway. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in northern Vietnam to investigate the structure of the live bird market (LBM) contact network and the implications for virus spread. Based on the movements of traders between LBMs, weighted and directed networks were constructed and used for social network analysis and individual-based modeling. Most LBMs were connected to one another, suggesting that the LBM network may support large-scale disease spread. Because of cross-border trade, it also may promote transboundary virus circulation. However, opportunities for disease control do exist. The implementation of thorough, daily disinfection of the market environment as well as of traders’ vehicles and equipment in only a small number of hubs can disconnect the network dramatically, preventing disease spread. These targeted interventions would be an effective alternative to the current policy of a complete ban of LBMs in some areas. Some LBMs that have been banned still are very active, and they likely have a substantial impact on disease dynamics, exhibiting the highest levels of susceptibility and infectiousness. The number of trader visits to markets, information that can be collected quickly and easily, may be used to identify LBMs suitable for implementing interventions. This would not require prior knowledge of the force of infection, for which laboratory-confirmed surveillance would be necessary. These findings are of particular relevance for policy development in resource-scarce settings.},

	abstract = {Contact structure among livestock populations influences the transmission of infectious agents among them. Models simulating realistic contact networks therefore have important applications for generating insights relevant to livestock diseases. This systematic review identifies and compares such models, their applications, data sources and how their validity was assessed. From 52 publications, 37 models were identified comprising seven model frameworks. These included mathematical models (n = 8; including generalized random graphs, scale-free, Watts–Strogatz and spatial models), agent-based models (n = 8), radiation models (n = 1) (collectively, considered ‘mechanistic’), gravity models (n = 4), exponential random graph models (n = 9), other forms of statistical model (n = 6) (statistical) and random forests (n = 1) (machine learning). Overall, nearly half of the models were used as inputs for network-based epidemiological models. In all models, edges represented livestock movements, sometimes alongside other forms of contact. Statistical models were often applied to infer factors associated with network formation (n = 12). Mechanistic models were commonly applied to assess the interaction between network structure and disease dissemination (n = 6). Mechanistic, statistical and machine learning models were all applied to generate networks given limited data (n = 13). There was considerable variation in the approaches used for model validation. Finally, we discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of model frameworks in different use cases.},

	abstract = {In West Africa, long and complex livestock value chains connect producers mostly in the Sahel with consumption basins in urban areas and the coast. Regional livestock trade is highly informal and, despite recent efforts to understand animal movement patterns in the region, remains largely unrecorded. Using CILSS’ database on intraregional livestock trade, we built yearly and overall weighted networks of animal movements between markets. We mapped and characterized the trade networks, identified market communities, key markets and their roles. Additionally, we compared the observed network properties with null-model generated ensembles. Most movements corresponded to cattle, were made by vehicle, and originated in Burkina Faso. We found that live animals in the central and eastern trade basins flow through well-defined, long distance trade corridors where markets tend to trade in a disassortive way with others in their proximity. Modularity-based communities indicated that both national and cross-border trade groups exist. The network’s degree and link distributions followed a log-normal or a power-law distribution, and key markets located primarily in urban centers and near borders serve as hubs that give peripheral markets access to the regional network. The null model ensembles could not reproduce the observed higher-level properties, particularly the propinquity and highly negative assortativity, suggesting that other possibly spatial factors shape the structure of regional live animal trade. Our findings support eliminating cross-border impediments and improving the condition of the regional road network, which limit intraregional trade of and contribute to the high prices of food products in West Africa. Although with limitations, our study sheds light on the abstruse structure of regional livestock trade, and the role of trade communities and markets in West Africa.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to show the importance of interspecies links and temporal network dynamics of a multi-species livestock movement network. Although both cattle and sheep networks have been previously studied, cattle-sheep multi-species networks have not generally been studied in-depth. The central question of this study is how the combination of cattle and sheep movements affects the potential for disease spread on the combined network. Our analysis considers static and temporal representations of networks based on recorded animal movements. We computed network-based node importance measures of two single-species networks, and compared the top-ranked premises with the ones in the multi-species network. We propose the use of a measure based on contact chains calculated in a network weighted with transmission probabilities to assess the importance of premises in an outbreak. To ground our investigation in infectious disease epidemiology, we compared this suggested measure with the results of disease simulation models with asymmetric probabilities of transmission between species. Our analysis of the temporal networks shows that the premises which are likely to drive the epidemic in this multi-species network differ from the ones in both the cattle and the sheep networks. Although sheep movements are highly seasonal, the estimated size of an epidemic is significantly larger in the multi-species network than in the cattle network, independently of the period of the year. Finally, we demonstrate that a measure based on contact chains allow us to identify around 30\% of the key farms in a simulated epidemic, ignoring markets, whilst static network measures identify less than 10\% of these farms. Our results ascertain the importance of combining species networks, as well as considering layers of temporal livestock movements in detail for the study of disease spread.},

In this study, we adopted methods from social network analysis to explore pig trades in Austria. We used a dataset of daily records of swine movements covering the period 2015–2021. We analyzed the topology of the network and its structural changes over time, including seasonal and long-term variations in the pig production activities. Finally, we studied the temporal dynamics of the network community structure. Our findings show that the Austrian pig production was dominated by small-sized farms while spatial farm density was heterogeneous. The network exhibited a scale-free topology but was very sparse, suggesting a moderate impact of infectious disease outbreaks. However, two regions (Upper Austria and Styria) may present a higher structural vulnerability. The network also showed very high assortativity between holdings from the same federal state. Dynamic community detection revealed a stable behavior of the clusters. Yet trade communities did not correspond to sub-national administrative divisions and may be an alternative zoning approach to managing infectious diseases. Knowledge about the topology, contact patterns, and temporal dynamics of the pig trade network can support optimized risk-based disease control and surveillance strategies.},

	abstract = {Livestock movements are a common pathway for the spread infectious diseases in a population. An understanding of livestock movement patterns is needed to understand national transmission risks of highly infectious diseases during epidemics. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an approach that helps to describe the relationships among individuals and the implications of those relationships. We used SNA to describe the contact structure of livestock movements throughout the contiguous U.S. from April 1st, 2015 to March 31st, 2016. We describe 4 network types: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminant. Livestock movement data were sourced from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) while county-level farm demographic data were from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In the described networks, nodes are represented by counties and arcs by shipments between nodes; the networks were weighted based on the number of shipments between nodes. For the analyses, movement data were aggregated at the county level and on an annual basis. Measures of centrality and cohesiveness were computed and identification of trade-communities in all networks was conducted. During the study period, a total of 219,042 movements were recorded and beef cattle movements accounted for 63 \% of all movements. At least 70 \% of U.S. counties were present in each of the networks, but the density of arcs was less than 2\% in all networks. In the beef cattle network, counties with high out-degree were strongly correlated (0.8) with the number of beef cows per county while for the dairy cattle network a strong correlation ({\textgreater}0.86) was found with the number of dairy cattle per km2 at the county level. All networks were found to have between 4 and 6 large communities (50 counties or more per community), and were geographically clustered except for the communities in the small ruminant network. Outputs reported in these analyses can help to understand the structure of the contact networks for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminants. They may also be used in conjunction with simulation modeling to evaluate spread of highly infectious disease such as foot-and-mouth disease at the national level and to evaluate the application of intervention strategies.},

Numerous types of meso-scale structures can occur in networks, but investigations of such features have focused predominantly on the identification and study of community structure.  In this paper, we develop a new method to investigate the meso-scale feature known as core-periphery structure, which entails identifying densely connected core nodes and sparsely connected peripheral nodes.  In contrast to communities, the nodes in a core are also reasonably well-connected to those in a network's periphery.  Our new method of computing core-periphery structure can identify multiple cores in a network and takes into account different possible core structures. We illustrate the differences between our method and several existing methods for identifying which nodes belong to a core, and we use our technique to examine core-periphery structure in examples of friendship, collaboration, transportation, and voting networks. For this new SIGEST version of our paper, we also discuss our work's relevance in the context of recent developments in the study of core-periphery structure.},

Understanding contact patterns is key to informing cost-effective surveillance and control strategies. In West and Central Africa some of the most rapid urbanization globally is expected to increase the demand for animal-source foods and the need for safer and more efficient animal production. Livestock trading points represent a strategic contact node in the dissemination of multiple pathogens. From October 2014 to May 2015 official transaction records were collected and a questionnaire-based survey was carried out in cattle markets throughout Western and Central-Northern Cameroon. The data were used to analyse the cattle trade network including a total of 127 livestock markets within Cameroon and five neighboring countries. This study explores for the first time the influence of animal trade on infectious disease spread in the region. The investigations showed that national borders do not present a barrier against pathogen dissemination and that non-neighbouring countries are epidemiologically connected, highlighting the importance of a regional approach to disease surveillance, prevention and control. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence for the benefit of strategic risk-based approaches for disease monitoring, surveillance and control, as well as for communication and training purposes through targeting key regions, highly connected livestock markets and central trading links.},

	abstract = {Understanding animal movements is an important factor for the development of meaningful surveillance and control programs, but also for the development of disease spread models. We analysed the Danish pig movement network using static and temporal network analysis tools to provide deeper insight in the connection between holdings dealing with pigs, such as breeding and multiplier herds, production herds, slaughterhouses or traders. Pig movements, which occurred between 1st January 2006 and 31st December 2015 in Denmark, were summarized to investigate temporal trends such as the number of active holdings, the number of registered movements and the number of pigs moved. To identify holdings and holding types with potentially higher risk for introduction or spread of diseases via pig movements, we determined loyalty patterns, annual network components and contact chains for the 24 registered holding types. The total number of active holdings as well as the number of pig movements decreased during the study period while the holding sizes increased. Around 60–90\% of connections between two pig holdings were present in two consecutive years and around one third of the connections persisted within the considered time period. Weaner herds showed the highest level of in-loyalty, whereas we observed an intermediate level of in-loyalty for all breeding sites and for production herds. Boar stations, production herds and trade herds showed a high level of out-loyalty. Production herds constituted the highest proportion of holdings in the largest strongly connected component. All production sites showed low levels of in-going contact chains and we observed a high level of out-going contact chain for breeding and multiplier herds. Except for livestock auctions, all transit sites also showed low levels of out-going contact chains. Our results reflect the pyramidal structure of the underlying network. Based on the considered disease, the time frame for the calculation of network measurements needs to be adapted. Using these adapted values for loyalty and contact chains might help to identify holdings with high potential of spreading diseases and thus limit the outbreak size or support control or eradication of the considered pathogen.},

	abstract = {Animal movements are a major driver for the spread of Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs). These movements link populations that would otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of the movement (‘slaughter’ vs. ‘live trade’) was used to subset the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.},

We focused on distance dependence in contacts and investigated how different functional forms affect estimates of unobserved intrastate shipments. To further enhance our predictions, we included responses from an expert elicitation survey about the proportion of shipments moving intrastate. We used hierarchical Bayesian modelling to estimate parameters describing the kernel and effects of expert data. We considered three functional forms of spatial kernels and the inclusion or exclusion of expert data. The resulting six models were ranked by widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) and deviance information criterion (DIC) and evaluated through within- and out-of-sample validation. We showed that predictions of intrastate shipments were mildly influenced by the functional form of the spatial kernel but kernel shapes that permitted a fat tail at large distances while maintaining a plateau-shaped behaviour at short distances better were preferred. Furthermore, our study showed that expert data may not guarantee enhanced predictions when expert estimates are disparate.},

As a consequence, the structure and dynamics of animal trade networks is a major focus of interest to control zoonosis. We investigate the impact of the chronology of animal trades on the dynamics of the process. Precisely, in the context of a basic SI model spreading, we measure on the French database of bovine transfers to what extent a snapshot-based analysis of the cattle trade networks overestimates the epidemic risks. We bring into light that an analysis taking into account the chronology of interactions would give a much more accurate assessment of both the size and speed of the process. For this purpose, we model data as a temporal network that we analyze using the link stream formalism in order to mix structural and temporal aspects. We also show that in this dataset, a basic SI spreading comes down in most cases to a simple two-phases scenario: a waiting period, with few contacts and low activity, followed by a linear growth of the number of infected holdings. Using this portrait of the spreading process, we identify efficient strategies to control a potential outbreak, based on the identification of specific elements of the link stream which have a higher probability to be involved in a spreading process.},

	abstract = {Background Animal trade plays an important role for the spread of infectious diseases in livestock populations. The central question of this work is how infectious diseases can potentially spread via trade in such a livestock population. We address this question by analyzing the underlying network of animal movements. In particular, we consider pig trade in Germany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. Methodology The considered pig trade dataset spans several years and is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases. Focusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage of external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific pathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any general spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system using different network models, which include varying amounts of information: (i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots, (iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account. Findings We find that a static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and premises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our results allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures using centrality measures. Data on trade volume do barely alter the results and is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description yields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding role for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in particular for an accurate calculation of the maximum outbreak size.},

Here, the movement data are used to construct an individual-farm-based model of the initial spread of FMD in GB and determine the susceptibility of the GB livestock industry to future outbreaks under the current legislative requirements. Transmission through movements is modelled, with additional local spread unrelated to the known movements. Simulations show that movements can result in a large nationwide epidemic, but only if cattle are heavily involved, or the epidemic occurs in late summer or early autumn. Inclusion of random local spread can considerably increase epidemic size, but has only a small impact on the spatial extent of the disease. There is a geographical bias in the epidemic size reached, with larger epidemics originating in Scotland and the north of England than elsewhere.},

There are many recent examples of disease spread that have occurred as a result of intentional movements of livestock or wildlife. Understanding the volume of these movements and the risks associated with them is fundamental in elucidating the epidemiology of these diseases, some of which might entail zoonotic risks. The importance of the worldwide animal trade is reviewed and the role of the unregulated trade in animals is highlighted. A range of key examples are discussed in which animal movements have resulted in the introduction of pathogens to previously disease-free areas. Measures based on heightened surveillance are proposed that mitigate the risks of new pathogen introductions.},

	abstract = {Transport of live animals is a major risk factor in the spread of infectious diseases between holdings. The present study analysed the pork supply chain of a producer community in Northern Germany. The structure of trade networks can be characterised by carrying out a network analysis. To identify holdings with a central position in this directed network of pig production, several parameters describing these properties were measured (in-degree, out-degree, ingoing and outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and ingoing and outgoing closeness centrality). To obtain the importance of the different holding types (multiplier, farrowing farms, finishing farms and farrow-to-finishing farms) within the pyramidal structure of the pork supply chain, centrality parameters were calculated for the entire network as well as for the individual holding types. Using these centrality parameters, two types of holdings could be identified. In the network studied, finishing and farrow-to-finishing farms were more likely to be infected due to the high number of ingoing trade contacts. Due to the high number of outgoing trade contacts multipliers and farrowing farms had an increased risk to spread a disease to other holdings. However, the results of the centrality parameters degree and infection chain were not always consistent, such that the indirect trade contacts should be taken into consideration to understand the real importance of a holding in spreading or contracting an infection. Furthermore, all calculated parameters showed a highly right-skewed distribution. Networks with such a degree distribution are considered to be highly resistant concerning the random removal of nodes. But by strategic removal of the most central holdings, e.g. by trade restrictions or selective vaccination or culling, the network structure can be changed efficiently and thus decompose into fragments. Such a fragmentation of the trade networks is of particular importance from an epidemiological perspective.},

	abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology–from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids–can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via e-mail, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names—temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. This review covers different fields where temporal graphs are considered, but does not attempt to unify related terminology—rather, we want to make papers readable across disciplines.},

	abstract = {Trade in live animals can contribute to the introduction of exotic diseases, the maintenance and spread endemic diseases. Annually millions of animals are moved across Europe for the purposes of breeding, fattening and slaughter. Data on the number of animals moved were obtained from the Directorate General Sanco (DG Sanco) for 2011. These were converted to livestock units to enable direct comparison across species and their movements were mapped, used to calculate the indegrees and outdegrees of 27 European countries and the density and transitivity of movements within Europe. This provided the opportunity to discuss surveillance of European livestock movement taking into account stopping points en-route. High density and transitivity of movement for registered equines, breeding and fattening cattle, breeding poultry and pigs for breeding, fattening and slaughter indicates that hazards have the potential to spread quickly within these populations. This is of concern to highly connected countries particularly those where imported animals constitute a large proportion of their national livestock populations, and have a high indegree. The transport of poultry (older than 72 hours) and unweaned animals would require more rest breaks than the movement of weaned animals, which may provide more opportunities for disease transmission. Transitivity is greatest for animals transported for breeding purposes with cattle, pigs and poultry having values of over 50\%. This paper demonstrated that some species (pigs and poultry) are traded much more frequently and at a larger scale than species such as goats. Some countries are more vulnerable than others due to importing animals from many countries, having imported animals requiring rest-breaks and importing large proportions of their national herd or flock. Such knowledge about the vulnerability of different livestock systems related to trade movements can be used to inform the design of animal health surveillance systems to facilitate the trade in animals between European member states.},

This study explores the potential disease risk resulting from large-scale, cross-border cattle trade between Togo, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria for the first time. Methods and Principal Findings A questionnaire-based survey of livestock movements of 226 cattle traders was conducted in the 9 biggest cattle markets of northern Togo in February-March 2012. More than half of the traders (53.5\%) operated in at least one other country. Animal flows were stochastically simulated based on reported movements and the risk of regional disease spread assessed. More than three quarters (79.2\%, range: 78.1–80.0\%) of cattle flowing into the market system originated from other countries. Through the cattle market system of northern Togo, non-neighbouring countries were connected via potential routes for disease spread. Even for diseases with low transmissibility and low prevalence in a given country, there was a high risk of disease introduction into other countries. Conclusions By stochastically simulating data collected by interviewing cattle traders in northern Togo, this study identifies potential risks for regional disease spread in West Africa through cross-border cattle trade. The findings highlight that surveillance for emerging infectious diseases as well as control activities targeting endemic diseases in West Africa are likely to be ineffective if only conducted at a national level. A regional approach to disease surveillance, prevention and control is essential.},

	abstract = {As globalization increases the interconnectedness between nations, economies, and industries, the introduction of diseases will continue to remain a prominent threat to the livestock sector and the trade of animals and animal products, as well as the livelihoods of farmers, food security and public health. The global pig sector, with its size and dichotomy between production type and biosecurity level, is particularly vulnerable to the transmission of transboundary animal diseases such as African and classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. All of the above pose a constant threat to swine health, mainly as a result of both formal and informal international trade. Inspired in the risk assessment methodology, this paper classifies and provides an overview of the different pig disease introduction and exposure pathways, illustrated with abundant examples. Introduction pathways are classified as formal international trade (by product), informal international trade (by product), and spread through fomites. Formal trade of pigs and pork products is regulated by legislation and measures protecting animal populations from exotic diseases. Much more difficult to control is the transboundary swine disease transmission originating through informal trade, which entails illegal smuggling, but also the informal cross-border transfer of animals and products for personal use or within informal market chains. Meat products are most commonly mentioned, although fomites have also played a role in some cases, with live pigs, being more difficult to smuggle playing a role less frequently. The main exposure pathways are also described with the oral route playing a prominent role. Risk assessments can aid in the identification of pathways of pathogen introduction and exposure. However, quantitative information on informal disease introduction pathways remains very scarce and often incomplete, making it difficult to estimate the actual magnitudes of risks. Nevertheless, this knowledge is deemed essential to set up risk based awareness, prevention and surveillance programs that correspond to reality.},

We show how to construct the spectral density profile of a phylogenetic tree from its Laplacian graph. Using ultrametric simulated trees as well as non-ultrametric empirical trees, we demonstrate that the spectral density successfully identifies various properties of the trees and clusters them into meaningful groups. Finally, we illustrate how the eigengap can identify modes of division within a given tree. As phylogenetic data continue to accumulate and to be integrated into various areas of the life sciences, we expect that this spectral graph-theoretical framework to phylogenetics will have powerful and long-lasting applications.},

	abstract = {Comparison among graphs is ubiquitous in graph analytics. However, it is a hard task in terms of the expressiveness of the employed similarity measure and the efficiency of its computation. Ideally, graph comparison should be invariant to the order of nodes and the sizes of compared graphs, adaptive to the scale of graph patterns, and scalable. Unfortunately, these properties have not been addressed together. Graph comparisons still rely on direct approaches, graph kernels, or representation-based methods, which are all inefficient and impractical for large graph collections. In this paper, we propose the Network Laplacian Spectral Descriptor (NetLSD): the first, to our knowledge, permutation- and size-invariant, scale-adaptive, and efficiently computable graph representation method that allows for straightforward comparisons of large graphs. NetLSD extracts a compact signature that inherits the formal properties of the Laplacian spectrum, specifically its heat or wave kernel; thus, it hears the shape of a graph. Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that it outperforms previous works in both expressiveness and efficiency.},

In this work, we calculate the Laplacian matrix analytically for two extreme cases, corresponding to fully balanced and fully unbalanced trees. For maximally balanced trees no closed form for the Laplacian matrix was derived, but we present an algorithm to construct it. We show that Laplacian matrices of fully balanced trees display self-similar patterns that result in highly degenerated eigenvalues. Degeneracy is the main signature of this topology, since it is totally absent in fully unbalanced trees. We also establish some analytical and numerical results about the largest eigenvalue of Laplacian matrices for these topologies.},

	abstract = {Many important graph parameters can be expressed as eigenfunctions of its adjacency matrix. Examples include epidemic threshold, graph robustness, etc. It is often of key importance to accurately monitor these parameters. For example, knowing that Ebola virus has already been brought to the US continent, to avoid the virus from spreading away, it is important to know which emerging connections among related people would cause great reduction on the epidemic threshold of the network. However, most, if not all, of the existing algorithms computing these measures assume that the input graph is static, despite the fact that almost all real graphs are evolving over time. In this paper, we propose two online algorithms to track the eigen-functions of a dynamic graph with linear complexity wrt the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the graph. The key idea is to leverage matrix perturbation theory to efﬁciently update the top eigen-pairs of the underlying graph without recomputing them from scratch at each time stamp. Experiment results demonstrate that our methods can reach up to 20× speedup with precision more than 80\% for fairly long period of time.},

	abstract = {The spectrum of a graph has been widely used in graph theory to characterise the properties of a graph and extract information from its structure. It has also been employed as a graph representation for pattern matching since it is invariant to the labelling of the graph. There are, however, a number of potential drawbacks in using the spectrum as a representation of a graph. Firstly, more than one graph may share the same spectrum. It is well known, for example, that very few trees can be uniquely specified by their spectrum. Secondly, the spectrum may change dramatically with a small change structure. There are a wide variety of graph matrix representations from which the spectrum can be extracted. Among these are the adjacency matrix, combinatorial Laplacian, normalised Laplacian and unsigned Laplacian. Spectra can also be derived from the heat kernel matrix and path length distribution matrix. The choice of matrix representation clearly has a large effect on the suitability of spectrum in a number of pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we investigate the performance of the spectra as a graph representation in a variety of situations. Firstly, we investigate the cospectrality of the various matrix representations over large graph and tree sets, extending the work of previous authors. We then show that the Euclidean distance between spectra tracks the edit distance between graphs over a wide range of edit costs, and we analyse the accuracy of this relationship. We then use the spectra to both cluster and classify the graphs and demonstrate the effect of the graph matrix formulation on error rates. These results are produced using both synthetic graphs and trees and graphs derived from shape and image data.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical work on phylogenetic birth–death models offers differing viewpoints on whether they can be estimated using lineage-through-time data. Louca and Pennell (2020) showed that the class of models with continuously differentiable rate functions is nonidentifiable: any such model is consistent with an infinite collection of alternative models, which are statistically indistinguishable regardless of how much data are collected. Legried and Terhorst (2022) qualified this grave result by showing that identifiability is restored if only piecewise constant rate functions are considered. Here, we contribute new theoretical results to this discussion, in both the positive and negative directions. Our main result is to prove that models based on piecewise polynomial rate functions of any order and with any (finite) number of pieces are statistically identifiable. In particular, this implies that spline-based models with an arbitrary number of knots are identifiable. The proof is simple and self-contained, relying mainly on basic algebra. We complement this positive result with a negative one, which shows that even when identifiability holds, rate function estimation is still a difficult problem. To illustrate this, we prove some rates-of-convergence results for hypothesis testing using birth–death models. These results are information-theoretic lower bounds which apply to all potential estimators.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

	abstract = {Species diversification is characterized by speciation and extinction, the rates of which can, under some assumptions, be estimated from time-calibrated phylogenies. However, maximum likelihood estimation methods (MLE) for inferring rates are limited to simpler models and can show bias, particularly in small phylogenies. Likelihood-free methods to estimate parameters of diversification models using deep learning have started to emerge, but how robust neural network methods are at handling the intricate nature of phylogenetic data remains an open question. Here we present a new ensemble neural network approach to estimate diversification parameters from phylogenetic trees that leverages different classes of neural networks (dense neural network, graph neural network, and long short-term memory recurrent network) and simultaneously learns from graph representations of phylogenies, their branching times and their summary statistics. Our best-performing ensemble neural network (which adjusts the graph neural network result using a recurrent neural network) delivers estimates faster than MLE and shows less sensitivity to tree size for constant-rate and diversity-dependent speciation scenarios. It performs well compared to an existing convolutional network approach. However, like MLE, our approach still fails to recover parameters precisely under a protracted birth-death process. Our analysis suggests that the primary limitation to accurate parameter estimation is the amount of information contained within a phylogeny, as indicated by its size and the strength of effects shaping it. In cases where MLE is unavailable, our neural network method provides a promising alternative for estimating phylogenetic tree parameters. If detectable phylogenetic signals are present, our approach delivers results that are comparable to MLE but without inherent biases.},

The algorithm leverages available prior knowledge on the model and on the data, and reconstructs both network structure and parameters of a spreading model.

	abstract = {Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. Empirical individual contact data provide unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity and are increasingly available, but are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in healthcare settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals’ wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recording bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. We validate our algorithm using data collected during the i-Bird study, and compare the empirical and reconstructed networks. The algorithm was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first–third quartiles observed: 0.54–0.64; synthetic: 0.52–0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39–0.50 vs 0.37–0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The algorithm consistently recreated unobserved contacts to generate full reconstructed networks for the LTCF. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other HCS using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.},

Recently, many novel models are proposed for ML on such graphs intensifying the need for robust evaluation and standardized benchmark datasets. However, the availability of such resources remains scarce and evaluation faces added complexity due to reproducibility issues in experimental protocols. To address these challenges, we introduce Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), a novel benchmarking framework tailored for evaluating methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs with a focus on large-scale datasets, extending the Temporal Graph Benchmark. TGB 2.0 facilitates comprehensive evaluations by presenting eight novel datasets spanning five domains with up to 53 million edges. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing datasets in terms of number of nodes, edges, or timestamps. In addition, TGB 2.0 provides a reproducible and realistic evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that 1) leveraging edge-type information is crucial to obtain high performance, 2) simple heuristic baselines are often competitive with more complex methods, 3) most methods fail to run on our largest datasets, highlighting the need for research on more scalable methods.},

	abstract = {Representation learning over temporal networks has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural dependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially, HTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture the evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information simultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important modules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to ensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant margins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves AUC improvement up to 9.98\% for link prediction and 11.4\% for new link prediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational ability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and HTC modules.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised representation learning for dynamic graphs has attracted a lot of research attention in recent years. Compared with static graph, the dynamic graph is a comprehensive embodiment of both the intrinsic stable characteristics of nodes and the time-related dynamic preference. However, existing methods generally mix these two types of information into a single representation space, which may lead to poor explanation, less robustness, and a limited ability when applied to different downstream tasks. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel disenTangled representation learning framework for discrete-time Dynamic graphs, namely DyTed. We specially design a temporal-clips contrastive learning task together with a structure contrastive learning to effectively identify the time-invariant and time-varying representations respectively. To further enhance the disentanglement of these two types of representation, we propose a disentanglement-aware discriminator under an adversarial learning framework from the perspective of information theory. Extensive experiments on Tencent and five commonly used public datasets demonstrate that DyTed, as a general framework that can be applied to existing methods, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, as well as be more robust against noise.},

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to many real-world static graphs. However, the success of static graphs has not fully translated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation settings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not incorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their performance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect the evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods for dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core, the ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time. We then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that mimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being updated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient training approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning. We conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future link prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on average 62.7\% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over state-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three datasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors for larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56 million edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training strategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5\% relative MRR improvement over the baselines.},

In this paper, we present Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), a generic, efficient framework for deep learning on dynamic graphs represented as sequences of timed events. Thanks to a novel combination of memory modules and graph-based operators, TGNs are able to significantly outperform previous approaches being at the same time more computationally efficient. We furthermore show that several previous models for learning on dynamic graphs can be cast as specific instances of our framework. We perform a detailed ablation study of different components of our framework and devise the best configuration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several transductive and inductive prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.},

	abstract = {Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs), which are prevalent in real-world implementations and notable for their ease of data acquisition, have garnered considerable attention from both academic researchers and industry practitioners. The representation learning of DTDGs has been extensively applied to model the dynamics of temporally changing entities and their evolving connections. Currently, DTDG representation learning predominantly relies on GNN+RNN architectures, which manifest the inherent limitations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing issue as the models architecture goes deeper, while RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies effectively. GNN+RNN architectures also grapple with scaling to large graph sizes and long sequences. Additionally, these methods often compute node representations separately and focus solely on individual node characteristics, thereby overlooking the behavior intersections between the two nodes whose link is being predicted, such as instances where the two nodes appear together in the same context or share common neighbors.  This paper introduces a novel representation learning method øurs{\textasciitilde}for DTDGs, pivoting from the traditional GNN+RNN framework to a Transformer-based architecture. Our approach exploits the attention mechanism to concurrently process topological information within the graph at each timestamp and temporal dynamics of graphs along the timestamps, circumventing the aforementioned fundamental weakness of both GNNs and RNNs. Moreover, we enhance the model's expressive capability by incorporating the intersection relationships among nodes and integrating a multi-patching module. Extensive experiments conducted on six public dynamic graph benchmark datasets confirm our model's efficacy, achieving the SOTA performance.},

However, developing expressive generative models for tabular data is challenging due to its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-correlations, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce TabDiff, a joint diffusion framework that models all mixed-type distributions of tabular data in one model. Our key innovation is the development of a joint continuous-time diffusion process for numerical and categorical data, where we propose feature-wise learnable diffusion processes to counter the high disparity of different feature distributions. TabDiff is parameterized by a transformer handling different input types, and the entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion. We further introduce a mixed-type stochastic sampler to automatically correct the accumulated decoding error during sampling, and propose classifier-free guidance for conditional missing column value imputation. Comprehensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that TabDiff achieves superior average performance over existing competitive baselines across all eight metrics, with up to \$22.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ improvement over the state-of-the-art model on pair-wise column correlation estimations.

	abstract = {New regulations and increased awareness of data privacy have led to the deployment of new and more efficient differentially private mechanisms across public institutions and industries. Ensuring the correctness of these mechanisms is therefore crucial to ensure the proper protection of data. However, since differential privacy is a property of the mechanism itself, and not of an individual output, testing whether a mechanism is differentially private is not a trivial task. While ad hoc testing techniques exist under specific assumptions, no concerted effort has been made by the research community to develop a flexible and extendable tool for testing differentially private mechanisms. This paper introduces DP-Auditorium as a step advancing research in this direction. DP-Auditorium abstracts the problem of testing differential privacy into two steps: (1) measuring the distance between distributions, and (2) finding neighboring datasets where a mechanism generates output distributions maximizing such distance. From a technical point of view, we propose three new algorithms for evaluating the distance between distributions. While these algorithms are well-established in the statistics community, we provide new estimation guarantees that exploit the fact that we are only interested in verifying whether a mechanism is differentially private, and not in obtaining an exact estimate of the distance between two distributions. DP-Auditorium is easily extensible, as demonstrated in this paper by implementing a well-known approximate differential privacy testing algorithm into our library. We provide an extensive comparison to date of multiple testers across varying sample sizes and differential privacy parameters, demonstrating that there is no single tester that dominates all others, and that a combination of different techniques is required to ensure proper testing of mechanisms.},

In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models. Our method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative modeling. We also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method expresses the natural one-to-many relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different pitches and rhythms. A subjective human evaluation (mean opinion score, or MOS) on the LJ Speech, a single speaker dataset, shows that our method outperforms the best publicly available TTS systems and achieves a MOS comparable to ground truth.},

In this work we review, demystify, and unify the understanding of diffusion models across both variational and score-based perspectives. We first derive Variational Diffusion Models (VDM) as a special case of a Markovian Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder, where three key assumptions enable tractable computation and scalable optimization of the ELBO. We then prove that optimizing a VDM boils down to learning a neural network to predict one of three potential objectives: the original source input from any arbitrary noisification of it, the original source noise from any arbitrarily noisified input, or the score function of a noisified input at any arbitrary noise level. We then dive deeper into what it means to learn the score function, and connect the variational perspective of a diffusion model explicitly with the Score-based Generative Modeling perspective through Tweedie's Formula. Lastly, we cover how to learn a conditional distribution using diffusion models via guidance.},

Many different methods have been proposed over the past decades, ranging from statistical methods to deep generative methods.

Despite the fact that score-based generative models have resolved many issues in generative models, there still exists room for improvement in tabular data synthesis. Our proposed training strategy includes a self-paced learning technique and a fine-tuning strategy, which further increases the sampling quality and diversity by stabilizing the denoising score matching training. Furthermore, we also conduct rigorous experimental studies in terms of the generative task trilemma: sampling quality, diversity, and time. In our experiments with 15 benchmark tabular datasets and 7 baselines, our method outperforms existing methods in terms of task-dependant evaluations and diversity.

The article also claims to have identified a breach in the differential privacy guarantees provided by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. When a study claims to refute or invalidate prior findings, it is crucial to verify and validate the study. In our work, we analyzed the implementation of the privacy game described in the article and found that it operated in a highly specialized and constrained environment, which limits the applicability of its findings to general cases. Our exploration also revealed that the game did not satisfy a crucial precondition concerning data distributions, which contributed to the perceived violation of the differential privacy guarantees offered by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. We also conducted a privacy-utility trade-off analysis in a more general and unconstrained environment. Our experimentation demonstrated that synthetic data achieves a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off compared to the provided implementation of k-anonymization, thereby reaffirming earlier conclusions.},

	abstract = {Link prediction is crucial for uncovering hidden connections within complex networks, enabling applications such as identifying potential customers and products. However, this research faces significant challenges, including concerns about data privacy, as well as high computational and storage costs, especially when dealing with large-scale networks. Condensed graphs, which are much smaller than the original graphs while retaining essential information, has become an effective solution to both maintain data utility and preserve privacy. Existing methods, however, initialize synthetic graphs through random node selection without considering node connectivity, and are mainly designed for node classification tasks. As a result, their potential for privacy-preserving link prediction remains largely unexplored. We introduce HyDRO{\textbackslash}textsuperscript\{+\}, a graph condensation method guided by algebraic Jaccard similarity, which leverages local connectivity information to optimize condensed graph structures. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and even the original networks in balancing link prediction accuracy and privacy preservation. Moreover, our method achieves nearly 20* faster training and reduces storage requirements by 452*, as demonstrated on the Computers dataset, compared to link prediction on the original networks. This work represents the first attempt to leverage condensed graphs for privacy-preserving link prediction information sharing in real-world complex networks. It offers a promising pathway for preserving link prediction information while safeguarding privacy, advancing the use of graph condensation in large-scale networks with privacy concerns.},

In this paper, we minimized these tune-able parameters. The DP-framework is developed which compares the differentially private results of three Python based DP libraries.

	abstract = {Dynamic link prediction aims to predict the future links on dynamic graphs, which can be applied to wide scenarios such as recommender systems and social networks on the World Wide Web. Existing methods mainly (1) focus on the in-graph learning, which cannot generalize to graphs unobserved during training; or (2) achieve the cross-graph predictions in a many-many mechanism by training on multiple graphs across various domains, which results in a large computational cost. In this paper, we propose a cross-graph dynamic link predictor named CrossDyG, which achieves the cross-graph transferability in a one-many mechanism which trains on one single source graph and test on different target graphs. Specifically, we provide causal and empirical analysis on the structural bias caused by the graph-specific structural characteristics in cross-graph predictions. Then, we conduct deconfounded training to learn the universal network evolution pattern from one single source graph during training. Finally, we apply the causal intervention to leverage the graph-specific structural characteristics of each target graph during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark data of dynamic graphs demonstrate that CrossDyG outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.01\% and 17.02\% in terms of AP and AUC, respectively. In addition, the improvements are especially significant when training on small source graphs. The implementation of our approach is available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossDyG-8B70.},

Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation.

First, we create two visualization techniques to understand the reoccurring patterns of edges over time and show that many edges reoccur at later time steps. Based on this observation, we propose a pure memorization baseline called EdgeBank. EdgeBank achieves surprisingly strong performance across multiple settings because easy negative edges are often used in the current evaluation setting. To evaluate against more difficult negative edges, we introduce two more challenging negative sampling strategies that improve robustness and better match real-world applications.

	abstract = {Agent-based models have gained traction in exploring the intricate processes governing the spread of infectious diseases, particularly due to their proficiency in capturing nonlinear interaction dynamics. The fidelity of agent-based models in replicating real-world epidemic scenarios hinges on the accurate portrayal of both population-wide and individual-level interactions. In situations where comprehensive population data are lacking, synthetic populations serve as a vital input to agent-based models, approximating real-world demographic structures. While some current population synthesizers consider the structural relationships among agents from the same household, there remains room for refinement in this domain, which could potentially introduce biases in subsequent disease transmission simulations. In response, this study unveils a novel methodology for generating synthetic populations tailored for infectious disease transmission simulations. By integrating insights from microsample-derived household structures, we employ a heuristic combinatorial optimizer to recalibrate these structures, subsequently yielding synthetic populations that faithfully represent agent structural relationships. Implementing this technique, we successfully generated a spatially-explicit synthetic population encompassing over 17 million agents for Shenzhen, China. The findings affirm the method’s efficacy in delineating the inherent statistical structural relationship patterns, aligning well with demographic benchmarks at both city and subzone tiers. Moreover, when assessed against a stochastic agent-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model, our results pinpointed that variations in population synthesizers can notably alter epidemic projections, influencing both the peak incidence rate and its onset.},

	abstract = {The most promising class of statistical models for expressing structural properties of social networks observed at one moment in time is the class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models. The strong point of these models is that they can represent a variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity, that define complicated dependence patterns not easily modeled by more basic probability models. Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been developed that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators. Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence problems of estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data. This paper proposes new specifications of exponential random graph models. These specifications represent structural properties such as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions, alternating k-triangles, and alternating independent two-paths. Examples are presented both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the new specifications lead to much better results than the earlier existing specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that the new specifications increase the range and applicability of the ERGM as a tool for the statistical analysis of social networks.},

	abstract = {A random field is the representation of the joint probability distribution for a set of random variables. Markov fields, in particular, have a long standing tradition as the theoretical foundation of many applications in statistical physics and probability. For strictly positive probability densities, a Markov random field is also a Gibbs field, i.e., a random field supplemented with a measure that implies the existence of a regular conditional distribution. Markov random fields have been used in statistical physics, dating back as far as the Ehrenfests. However, their measure theoretical foundations were developed much later by Dobruschin, Lanford and Ruelle, as well as by Hammersley and Clifford. Aside from its enormous theoretical relevance, due to its generality and simplicity, Markov random fields have been used in a broad range of applications in equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, in non-linear dynamics and ergodic theory. Also in computational molecular biology, ecology, structural biology, computer vision, control theory, complex networks and data science, to name but a few.

	abstract = {Speciation and extinction rates can be estimated from molecular phylogenies. Recently, a number of methods have been published showing that these rates can be estimated even if the phylogeny is incomplete, that is, if not all extant species are included. We show that the accuracy of such methods strongly depends on making the correct assumptions about how the sampling process was performed. We focus on phylogenies that are incomplete because some subclades (e.g., genera and families) are each represented as a single lineage. We show that previous methods implicitly assumed that such subclades are defined by randomly (or in an extreme deterministic way) choosing the edges that define the subclades from the complete species phylogeny. We show that these methods produce biased results if higher taxa are defined in a different manner. We introduce strict higher level phylogenies where subclades are defined so that the phylogeny is fully resolved from its origin to time xcut, and fully unresolved thereafter, so that for all subclades, stem age \&gt; xcut \&gt; crown age. We present estimates of speciation and extinction rates from a phylogeny of birds in which this subclade definition was applied. However, for most higher level phylogenies in the literature, it is unclear how higher taxa were defined, but often such phylogenies can be easily transformed into strict higher level phylogenies, as we illustrate by estimating speciation and extinction rates from a near-complete but only partly resolved species-level phylogeny of mammals. The accuracy of our methods is verified using simulations. [Birth–death process; higher taxa; macroevolution; phylogenetics.]},

            Some branches of the tree of life are incredibly diverse, while others are represented by only a few living species. Ultimately, this difference reflects the balance of the formation and the extinction of species. Countless explanations have been proposed for why the rates of these two processes vary between lineages, including aspects of the organisms themselves and the environments they live in. Here we reveal that a substantial amount of variation in these rates is associated with a simple factor: time. Younger groups appear to accumulate diversity at much faster rates than older groups. This time scaling of macroevolutionary rates suggests that there may be hidden generalities governing the diversification of life on Earth.
          , 
            For centuries, biologists have been captivated by the vast disparity in species richness between different groups of organisms. Variation in diversity is widely attributed to differences between groups in how fast they speciate or go extinct. Such macroevolutionary rates have been estimated for thousands of groups and have been correlated with an incredible variety of organismal traits. Here we analyze a large collection of phylogenetic trees and fossil time series and describe a hidden generality among these seemingly idiosyncratic results: speciation and extinction rates follow a scaling law in which both depend on the age of the group in which they are measured, with the fastest rates in the youngest clades. Using a series of simulations and sensitivity analyses, we demonstrate that the time dependency is unlikely to be a result of simple statistical artifacts. As such, this time scaling is likely a genuine feature of the tree of life, hinting that the dynamics of biodiversity over deep time may be driven in part by surprisingly simple and general principles.},

	abstract = {A phylogenetic tree represents hypothesized evolutionary history for a set of taxa. Besides the branching patterns (i.e., tree topology), phylogenies contain information about the evolutionary distances (i.e. branch lengths) between all taxa in the tree, which include extant taxa (external nodes) and their last common ancestors (internal nodes). During phylogenetic tree inference, the branch lengths are typically co-estimated along with other phylogenetic parameters during tree topology space exploration. There are well-known regions of the branch length parameter space where accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees is especially difficult. Several novel studies have recently demonstrated that machine learning approaches have the potential to help solve phylogenetic problems with greater accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, as a proof of concept, we sought to explore the possibility of machine learning models to predict branch lengths. To that end, we designed several deep learning frameworks to estimate branch lengths on fixed tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments or its representations. Our results show that deep learning methods can exhibit superior performance in some difficult regions of branch length parameter space. For example, in contrast to maximum likelihood inference, which is typically used for estimating branch lengths, deep learning methods are more efficient and accurate. In general, we find that our neural networks achieve similar accuracy to a Bayesian approach and are the best-performing methods when inferring long branches that are associated with distantly related taxa. Together, our findings represent a next step toward accurate, fast, and reliable phylogenetic inference with machine learning approaches.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic inference is of fundamental importance to evolutionary as well as other fields of biology, and molecular sequences have emerged as the primary data for this task. Although many phylogenetic methods have been developed to explicitly take into account substitution models of sequence evolution, such methods could fail due to model misspecification or insufficiency, especially in the face of heterogeneities in substitution processes across sites and among lineages. In this study, we propose to infer topologies of four-taxon trees using deep residual neural networks, a machine learning approach needing no explicit modeling of the subject system and having a record of success in solving complex nonlinear inference problems. We train residual networks on simulated protein sequence data with extensive amino acid substitution heterogeneities. We show that the well-trained residual network predictors can outperform existing state-of-the-art inference methods such as the maximum likelihood method on diverse simulated test data, especially under extensive substitution heterogeneities. Reassuringly, residual network predictors generally agree with existing methods in the trees inferred from real phylogenetic data with known or widely believed topologies. Furthermore, when combined with the quartet puzzling algorithm, residual network predictors can be used to reconstruct trees with more than four taxa. We conclude that deep learning represents a powerful new approach to phylogenetic reconstruction, especially when sequences evolve via heterogeneous substitution processes.

Multiple methods exist to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Both simulation and empirical studies have identified several “zones” of parameter space where accuracy of some methods can plummet, even for four-taxon trees. Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency and/or the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research. In this study, we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate on simulated data, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and posterior probability scores from traditional methods. Although numerous practical challenges remain, these findings suggest that the deep learning approaches such as ours have the potential to produce more accurate phylogenetic inferences.},

Here, we present a machine learning method, CorrTest, to detect the presence of rate autocorrelation in large phylogenies. CorrTest is computationally efficient and performs better than the available state-of-the-art method. Application of CorrTest reveals extensive rate autocorrelation in DNA and amino acid sequence evolution of mammals, birds, insects, metazoans, plants, fungi, parasitic protozoans, and prokaryotes. Therefore, rate autocorrelation is a common phenomenon throughout the tree of life. These findings suggest concordance between molecular and nonmolecular evolutionary patterns, and they will foster unbiased and precise dating of the tree of life.},

Likelihood-based methods fit models to phylogenies to draw inferences about the phylodynamics and history of viral transmission. However, these methods are often computationally expensive, which limits the complexity and realism of phylodynamic models and makes them ill-suited for informing policy decisions in real-time during rapidly developing outbreaks. Likelihood-free methods using deep learning are pushing the boundaries of inference beyond these constraints. In this paper, we extend, compare, and contrast a recently developed deep learning method for likelihood-free inference from trees. We trained multiple deep neural networks using phylogenies from simulated outbreaks that spread among 5 locations and found they achieve close to the same levels of accuracy as Bayesian inference under the true simulation model. We compared robustness to model misspecification of a trained neural network to that of a Bayesian method. We found that both models had comparable performance, converging on similar biases. We also implemented a method of uncertainty quantification called conformalized quantile regression that we demonstrate has similar patterns of sensitivity to model misspecification as Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) and greatly overlap with HPDs, but have lower precision (more conservative). Finally, we trained and tested a neural network against phylogeographic data from a recent study of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe and obtained similar estimates of region-specific epidemiological parameters and the location of the common ancestor in Europe. Along with being as accurate and robust as likelihood-based methods, our trained neural networks are on average over 3 orders of magnitude faster after training. Our results support the notion that neural networks can be trained with simulated data to accurately mimic the good and bad statistical properties of the likelihood functions of generative phylogenetic models.},

To assess the effect of a character on diversification rates using likelihood methods requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution (the “BiSSE” model, binary-state speciation and extinction). The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state 1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate the application of the method using simulated data with known parameter values.},

Here we propose an approach that is based on mapping morphometric traits onto phylogenies derived from other data and thus avoids the pitfalls encountered by previous studies. This method treats shape as a single, multidimensional character. We propose a test for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in morphometric data, which simulates the null hypothesis of the complete absence of phylogenetic structure by permutation of the shape data among the terminal taxa. We also propose 2 measures of the fit of morphometric data to the phylogeny that are direct extensions of the consistency index and retention index used in traditional cladistics. We apply these methods to a small study of the evolution of wing shape in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, for which a very strongly supported phylogeny is available. This case study reveals a significant phylogenetic signal and a relatively low degree of homoplasy. Despite the low homoplasy, the shortest tree computed from landmark data on wing shape is inconsistent with the well-supported phylogenetic tree from molecular data, underscoring that morphometric data may not provide reliable information for inferring phylogeny.},

However, proactively assessing the potential for phylogenetic noise compared with signal in a candidate data set has been a formidable challenge. Understanding the impact of collection of additional sequence data to resolve recalcitrant internodes at diverse historical times will facilitate increasingly accurate and cost-effective phylogenetic research. Here, we derive theory based on the fundamental unit of the phylogenetic tree, the quartet, that applies estimates of the state space and the rates of evolution of characters in a data set to predict phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic noise and therefore to predict the power to resolve internodes. We develop and implement a Monte Carlo approach to estimating power to resolve as well as deriving a nearly equivalent faster deterministic calculation. These approaches are applied to describe the distribution of potential signal, polytomy, or noise for two example data sets, one recent (cytochrome c oxidase I and 28S ribosomal rRNA sequences from Diplazontinae parasitoid wasps) and one deep (eight nuclear genes and a phylogenomic sequence for diverse microbial eukaryotes including Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Rhizaria). The predicted power of resolution for the loci analyzed is consistent with the historic use of the genes in phylogenetics.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) are powerful black box predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem.  Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian)  NNs.  We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

	abstract = {Minimization of a sum-of-squares or cross-entropy error function leads to network outputs which approximate the conditional averages of the target data, conditioned on the input vector. For classifications problems, with a suitably chosen target coding scheme, these averages represent the posterior probabilities of class membership, and so can be regarded as optimal. For problems involving the prediction of continuous variables, however, the conditional averages provide only a very limited description of the properties of the target variables. This is particularly true for problems in which the mapping to be learned is multi-valued, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems, since the average of several correct target values is not necessarily itself a correct value. In order to obtain a complete description of the data, for the purposes of predicting the outputs corresponding to new input vectors, we must model the conditional probability distribution of the target data, again conditioned on the input vector. In this paper we introduce a new class of network models obtained by combining a conventional neural network with a mixture density model. The complete system is called a Mixture Density Network, and can in principle represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions in the same way that a conventional neural network can represent arbitrary functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixture Density Networks using both a toy problem and a problem involving robot inverse kinematics.},

On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model - uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary history of a set of taxa is usually represented by a phylogenetic tree, and this model has greatly facilitated the discussion and testing of hypotheses. However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly described by such models. Further, even when evolution proceeds in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served by using methods that enforce a tree structure but rather by a richer visualization of the data to evaluate its properties, at least as an essential first step. Thus, phylogenetic networks should be employed when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, or gene duplication and loss are believed to be involved, and, even in the absence of such events, phylogenetic networks have a useful role to play. This article reviews the terminology used for phylogenetic networks and covers both split networks and reticulate networks, how they are defined, and how they can be interpreted. Additionally, the article outlines the beginnings of a comprehensive statistical framework for applying split network methods. We show how split networks can represent confidence sets of trees and introduce a conservative statistical test for whether the conflicting signal in a network is treelike. Finally, this article describes a new program, SplitsTree4, an interactive and comprehensive tool for inferring different types of phylogenetic networks from sequences, distances, and trees.},

Although confidence in some of the tree's early branches has recently been shaken, new approaches could still resolve many methodological uncertainties. More challenging is evidence that most archaeal and bacterial genomes (and the inferred ancestral eukaryotic nuclear genome) contain genes from multiple sources. If “chimerism” or “lateral gene transfer” cannot be dismissed as trivial in extent or limited to special categories of genes, then no hierarchical universal classification can be taken as natural. Molecular phylogeneticists will have failed to find the “true tree,” not because their methods are inadequate or because they have chosen the wrong genes, but because the history of life cannot properly be represented as a tree. However, taxonomies based on molecular sequences will remain indispensable, and understanding of the evolutionary process will ultimately be enriched, not impoverished.},

However, we lack a general framework that can delineate and quantify heterogeneous mixtures of dynamic processes within single phylogenies. I developed a method that can identify arbitrary numbers of time-varying diversification processes on phylogenies without specifying their locations in advance. The method uses reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo to move between model subspaces that vary in the number of distinct diversification regimes. The model assumes that changes in evolutionary regimes occur across the branches of phylogenetic trees under a compound Poisson process and explicitly accounts for rate variation through time and among lineages. Using simulated datasets, I demonstrate that the method can be used to quantify complex mixtures of time-dependent, diversity-dependent, and constant-rate diversification processes. I compared the performance of the method to the MEDUSA model of rate variation among lineages. As an empirical example, I analyzed the history of speciation and extinction during the radiation of modern whales. The method described here will greatly facilitate the exploration of macroevolutionary dynamics across large phylogenetic trees, which may have been shaped by heterogeneous mixtures of distinct evolutionary processes.},

However, there has been considerable debate surrounding the reliability of these inferences2–5 and, to date, this critical question remains unresolved. Here we clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant timetrees under the generalized birth–death model, which underlies most existing methods of estimation. We prove that, for any diversification scenario, there exists an infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to have generated any given extant timetree. These ‘congruent’ scenarios cannot possibly be distinguished using extant timetrees alone, even in the presence of infinite data. Importantly, congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly different and yet similarly plausible dynamics, which suggests that many previous studies may have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence. We introduce identifiable and easily interpretable variables that contain all available information about past diversification dynamics, and demonstrate that these can be estimated from extant timetrees. We suggest that measuring and modelling these identifiable variables offers a more robust way to study historical diversification dynamics. Our findings also make it clear that palaeontological data will continue to be crucial for answering some macroevolutionary questions.},

We report here theoretical properties of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators for these parameters, including their non-uniqueness and inaccuracy, and show that theoretical expectations indeed apply to real trees. We provide necessary conditions for ML estimators to be well defined and practical implications for model parametrization. We then show how these limitations carry over to difficulties in detecting shifts in selection regimes along a phylogeny. When the phylogenetic placement of these shifts is unknown, we identify a ‘large p - small n’ problem where traditional model selection criteria fail and favour overly complex scenarios. Instead, we propose a modified criterion that is better adapted to change-point models. The challenges we identify here are inherent to trait evolution models on phylogenetic trees when observations are limited to present-day taxa, and require the addition of fossil taxa to be alleviated.

	abstract = {Statistical and mathematical models are defined by parameters that describe different characteristics of those models. Ideally it would be possible to find parameter estimates for every parameter in that model, but, in some cases, this is not possible. For example, two parameters that only ever appear in the model as a product could not be estimated individually; only the product can be estimated. Such a model is said to be parameter redundant, or the parameters are described as non-identifiable. This book explains why parameter redundancy and non-identifiability is a problem and the different methods that can be used for detection, including in a Bayesian context. 

Key features of this book:


Detailed discussion of the problems caused by parameter redundancy and non-identifiability


Explanation of the different general methods for detecting parameter redundancy and non-identifiability, including symbolic algebra and numerical methods


Chapter on Bayesian identifiability


Throughout illustrative examples are used to clearly demonstrate each problem and method. Maple and R code are available for these examples


More in-depth focus on the areas of discrete and continuous state-space models and ecological statistics, including methods that have been specifically developed for each of these areas


This book is designed to make parameter redundancy and non-identifiability accessible and understandable to a wide audience from masters and PhD students to researchers, from mathematicians and statisticians to practitioners using mathematical or statistical models.},

However, identifying adaptive radiations has proven difficult due to a lack of broad-scale comparative datasets. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative data on body size and shape in a diversity of animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation, in which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to both single selective peak and random walk models. We found little support for the early-burst model of adaptive radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to evolve most rapidly because long-term change typically does not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates measured over short time scales. Across our entire analysis, the dominant pattern was one of constraints shaping evolution continually through time rather than rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological evolution is initially rapid and slows through time, may be rare in comparative data.},

Two aspects of tree shape are particularly important: tree balance and the distribution of branch lenghts. We examine and evaluate recent developments in and connections between these two aspects, and suggest directions for future research. Studies of tree shape promise useful and powerful tests of macroevolutionary hypotheses. With appropriate further research, tree shape may help us detect mass extinctions and adaptive radiations, measure continuos variation in speciation and extinction rates, and associate changes in these rates with ecological or biogeographical causes. The usefulness of tree shape extends well beyond the study of macroevolution.

I used simulation models to investigate the parallel influence of locality area, immigration rate, and environmental heterogeneity on species diversity and genetic diversity. The most common pattern was moderate to strong positive species‐genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs). Such correlations may be driven by any one of the three locality characteristics examined, but important exceptions and patterns emerged. Genetic diversity and species diversity were more weakly correlated when genetic diversity was measured for rare versus common species. Environmental heterogeneity not only imposes spatially varying selection on populations and communities but also causes changes in species’ population sizes and therefore genetic diversity; these interacting processes can create positive, negative, or unimodal relationships of genetic diversity with species diversity. When species are considered as part of multispecies communities, predictions from single‐species models of genetic diversity apply in some instances (effects of area and immigration) but often not in others (effects of environmental heterogeneity).},

We consider two interpretations of random characters: first, that the number of taxa with each state is held constant, but the states are randomly reshuffled among the taxa; and second, that the probability each taxon is assigned a particular state is constant from one taxon to the next. Under null models representing various combinations of randomizations of trees and characters, exact recursion equations are given to calculate the probability distribution of the number of character state changes required by a phylogenetic tree. Possible applications of these probability distributions are discussed. They can be used, for example, to test for a panmictic population structure within a species or to test phylogenetic inertia in a character's evolution. Whether and how a null model incorporates tree randomness makes little difference to the probability distribution in many but not all circumstances. The null model's sense of character randomness appears more critical. The difficult issue of choosing a null model is discussed.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary relationships are typically inferred from molecular sequence data using a statistical model of the evolutionary process. When the model accurately reflects the underlying process, probabilistic phylogenetic methods recover the correct relationships with high accuracy. There is ample evidence, however, that models commonly used today do not adequately reflect real-world evolutionary dynamics. Virtually all contemporary models assume that relatively fast-evolving sites are fast across the entire tree, whereas slower sites always evolve at relatively slower rates. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called “heterotachy.” Here we examine the accuracy of 2 phylogenetic methods for incorporating heterotachy, the mixed branch length model—which incorporates site-specific rate changes by summing likelihoods over multiple sets of branch lengths on the same tree—and the covarion model, which uses a hidden Markov process to allow sites to switch between variable and invariable as they evolve. Under a variety of simple heterogeneous simulation conditions, the mixed model was dramatically more accurate than homotachous models, which were subject to topological biases as well as biases in branch length estimates. When data were simulated with strong versions of the types of heterotachy observed in real molecular sequences, the mixed branch length model was more accurate than homotachous techniques. Analyses of empirical data sets confirmed that the mixed branch length model can improve phylogenetic accuracy under conditions that cause homotachous models to fail. In contrast, the covarion model did not improve phylogenetic accuracy compared with homotachous models and was sometimes substantially less accurate. We conclude that a mixed branch length approach, although not the solution to all phylogenetic errors, is a valuable strategy for improving the accuracy of inferred trees.},

This result is based on a particular set of branch lengths produced by the common coalescent, where pendant branches leading to tips can be very short compared with branches deeper in the tree. Here, we analyze alternative and more realistic Yule and birth–death models. We show how censoring at the present both makes average branches one half what we might expect and makes pendant and interior branches roughly equal in length. Although dependent on whether we condition on the size of the tree, its age, or both, these results hold both for the Yule model and for birth–death models with moderate extinction. Importantly, the rough equivalency in interior and exterior branch lengths means that the loss of evolutionary history with loss of species can be roughly linear. Under these models, the Tree of Life may offer limited redundancy in the face of ongoing species loss.},

have been shown to outperform the harmonic mean estimator (HME) and a posterior

clock models. Almost simultaneously, a Bayesian model averaging approach was
developed that avoids conditioning on a single model but averages over a set of
relaxed clock models. This approach returns estimates of the posterior
probability of each clock model through which one can estimate the Bayes factor
in favor of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clock model; however, this Bayes
factor estimate may suffer when the posterior probability of the MAP model
approaches 1. Here, we compare these two recent developments with the HME,
stabilized/smoothed HME (sHME), and AICM, using both synthetic and empirical
data. Our comparison shows reassuringly that MAP identification and its Bayes
factor provide similar performance to PS and SS and that these approaches
considerably outperform HME, sHME, and AICM in selecting the correct underlying
clock model. We also illustrate the importance of using proper priors on a large

	abstract = {The molecular clock presents a means of estimating evolutionary rates and timescales using genetic data. These estimates can lead to important insights into evolutionary processes and mechanisms, as well as providing a framework for further biological analyses. To deal with rate variation among genes and among lineages, a diverse range of molecular-clock methods have been developed. These methods have been implemented in various software packages and differ in their statistical properties, ability to handle different models of rate variation, capacity to incorporate various forms of calibrating information and tractability for analysing large data sets. Choosing a suitable molecular-clock model can be a challenging exercise, but a number of model-selection techniques are available. In this review, we describe the different forms of evolutionary rate heterogeneity and explain how they can be accommodated in molecular-clock analyses. We provide an outline of the various clock methods and models that are available, including the strict clock, local clocks, discrete clocks and relaxed clocks. Techniques for calibration and clock-model selection are also described, along with methods for handling multilocus data sets. We conclude our review with some comments about the future of molecular clocks.},

However, it is unclear which model has the best fit to real data and should therefore be used to perform molecular dating. In particular, we do not know whether rate autocorrelation should be considered or which prior on divergence times should be used. In this work, we propose a general bench mark of alternative relaxed clock models. We have reimplemented most of the already existing models, including the popular lognormal model, as well as various prior choices for divergence times (birth–death, Dirichlet, uniform), in a common Bayesian statistical framework. We also propose a new autocorrelated model, called the “CIR” process, with well-defined stationary properties. We assess the relative fitness of these models and priors, when applied to 3 different protein data sets from eukaryotes, vertebrates, and mammals, by computing Bayes factors using a numerical method called thermodynamic integration. We find that the 2 autocorrelated models, CIR and lognormal, have a similar fit and clearly outperform uncorrelated models on all 3 data sets. In contrast, the optimal choice for the divergence time prior is more dependent on the data investigated. Altogether, our results provide useful guidelines for model choice in the field of molecular dating while opening the way to more extensive model comparisons.},

We apply the new method to a longitudinal sample of DNA sequences of the env gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from a single patient and obtain 1.62 × 10 as the mutation rate per site per year for HIV-1. Using an independent data set to estimate the mutation rate per generation, we obtain 1.8 days as the length of a generation of HIV-1, which agrees well with recent estimates based on viral load data. Our estimate of generation time differs considerably from a recent estimate by Rodrigo et al. when the same mutation rate per site per generation is used.

Many studies have suggested that rate of molecular evolution is linked to rate of diversification, but few have evaluated competing hypotheses. By analyzing sequences from 130 families of angiosperms, we show that variation in the synonymous substitution rate is correlated among genes from the mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear genomes and linked to differences in traits among families (average height and genome size). Within each genome, synonymous rates are correlated to nonsynonymous substitution rates, suggesting that increasing the mutation rate results in a faster rate of genome evolution. Substitution rates are correlated with species richness in protein-coding sequences from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. These data suggest that species traits contribute to lineage-specific differences in the mutation rate that drive both synonymous and nonsynonymous rates of change across all three genomes, which in turn contribute to greater rates of divergence between populations, generating higher rates of diversification. These observations link mutation in individuals to population-level processes and to patterns of lineage divergence.},

Differences in the timing of evolutionary events estimated from genetic and fossil evidence have raised further questions about the existence of molecular clocks and their use. Here we present a model of nucleotide substitution that combines new theory on metabolic rate with the now classic neutral theory of molecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity, and reconciles differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionary events. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperature on metabolic rate, a single molecular clock explains heterogeneity in rates of nucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments. This model suggests that there is indeed a general molecular clock, as originally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling, but that it ticks at a constant substitution rate per unit mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit time. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combine to control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.},

However, these methods normally assume that trees and models are known without error. Approaches relying on evolutionary regimes also assume specific distributions of character states across a tree, which often result from ancestral state reconstructions that are subject to uncertainty. Several methods have been proposed to deal with some of these sources of uncertainty, but approaches accounting for all of them are less common. Here, we show how Bayesian statistics facilitates this task while relaxing the homogeneous rate assumption of the well-known phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) framework. This Bayesian formulation allows uncertainty about phylogeny, evolutionary regimes, or other statistical parameters to be taken into account for studies as simple as testing for coevolution in two traits or as complex as testing whether bursts of phenotypic change are associated with evolutionary shifts in intertrait correlations. A mixture of validation approaches indicates that the approach has good inferential properties and predictive performance. We provide suggestions for implementation and show its usefulness by exploring the coevolution of ankle posture and forefoot proportions in Carnivora.},

When evolutionary distances (dij's) are large and sequences under study are not very long, however, the OLS criterion is often biased and may choose an incorrect tree more often than expected under random choice. It is also shown that the variance-covariance matrix of dij's becomes singular as dij's approach zero and thus the GLS may not be applicable when dij's are small. The ME method suffers from neither of these problems, and the ME criterion is statistically unbiased. Computer simulation has shown that the ME method is more efficient in obtaining the true tree than the OLS and GLS methods and that the OLS is more efficient than the GLS when dij's are small, but otherwise the GLS is more efficient.},

	abstract = {Working with high-dimensional phylogenetic comparative data sets is challenging because likelihood-based multivariate methods suffer from low statistical performances as the number of traits \$p \$ approaches the number of species \$n \$ and because some computational complications occur when \$p \$ exceeds \$n\$. Alternative phylogenetic comparative methods have recently been proposed to deal with the large \$p \$ small \$n \$ scenario but their use and performances are limited. Herein, we develop a penalized likelihood (PL) framework to deal with high-dimensional comparative data sets. We propose various penalizations and methods for selecting the intensity of the penalties. We apply this general framework to the estimation of parameters (the evolutionary trait covariance matrix and parameters of the evolutionary model) and model comparison for the high-dimensional multivariate Brownian motion (BM), Early-burst (EB), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU), and Pagel’s lambda models. We show using simulations that our PL approach dramatically improves the estimation of evolutionary trait covariance matrices and model parameters when \$p\$ approaches \$n\$, and allows for their accurate estimation when \$p\$ equals or exceeds \$n\$. In addition, we show that PL models can be efficiently compared using generalized information criterion (GIC). We implement these methods, as well as the related estimation of ancestral states and the computation of phylogenetic principal component analysis in the R package RPANDA and mvMORPH. Finally, we illustrate the utility of the new proposed framework by evaluating evolutionary models fit, analyzing integration patterns, and reconstructing evolutionary trajectories for a high-dimensional 3D data set of brain shape in the New World monkeys. We find a clear support for an EB model suggesting an early diversification of brain morphology during the ecological radiation of the clade. PL offers an efficient way to deal with high-dimensional multivariate comparative data.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen increased interest in phylogenetic comparative analyses of multivariate data sets, but to date the varied proposed approaches have not been extensively examined. Here we review the mathematical properties required of any multivariate method, and specifically evaluate existing multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods in this context. Phylogenetic comparative methods based on the full multivariate likelihood are robust to levels of covariation among trait dimensions and are insensitive to the orientation of the data set, but display increasing model misspecification as the number of trait dimensions increases. This is because the expected evolutionary covariance matrix (V) used in the likelihood calculations becomes more ill-conditioned as trait dimensionality increases, and as evolutionary models become more complex. Thus, these approaches are only appropriate for data sets with few traits and many species. Methods that summarize patterns across trait dimensions treated separately (e.g., SURFACE) incorrectly assume independence among trait dimensions, resulting in nearly a 100\% model misspecification rate. Methods using pairwise composite likelihood are highly sensitive to levels of trait covariation, the orientation of the data set, and the number of trait dimensions. The consequences of these debilitating deficiencies are that a user can arrive at differing statistical conclusions, and therefore biological inferences, simply from a dataspace rotation, like principal component analysis. By contrast, algebraic generalizations of the standard phylogenetic comparative toolkit that use the trace of covariance matrices are insensitive to levels of trait covariation, the number of trait dimensions, and the orientation of the data set. Further, when appropriate permutation tests are used, these approaches display acceptable Type I error and statistical power. We conclude that methods summarizing information across trait dimensions, as well as pairwise composite likelihood methods should be avoided, whereas algebraic generalizations of the phylogenetic comparative toolkit provide a useful means of assessing macroevolutionary patterns in multivariate data. Finally, we discuss areas in which multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods are still in need of future development; namely highly multivariate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models and approaches for multivariate evolutionary model comparisons.},

This debate, however, lacks any quantitative assessment of the impact of HGT on phylogenies and of the ability of tree-building methods to cope with such events. I introduce a Markov model of genome evolution with HGT, accounting for the constraints on time—an HGT event can only occur between concomitantly living species. This model is used to simulate multigene sequence data sets with or without HGT. The consequences of HGT on phylogenomic inference are analyzed and compared to other well-known phylogenetic artefacts. It is found that supertree methods are quite robust to HGT, keeping high levels of performance even when gene trees are largely incongruent with each other. Gene tree incongruence per se is not indicative of HGT. HGT, however, removes the (otherwise observed) positive relationship between sequence length and gene tree congruence to the estimated species tree. Surprisingly, when applied to a bacterial and a eukaryotic multigene data set, this criterion rejects the HGT hypothesis for the former, but not the latter data set.},

In modern organisms we suggest that both the range and frequencies of HGT are constrained most often by selective barriers. As a consequence those HGT events that do occur most often have little influence on genome phylogeny. Although HGT does occur with important evolutionary consequences, classical Darwinian lineages seem to be the dominant mode of evolution for modern organisms.},

	abstract = {While much of evolutionary biology attempts to explain the processes of diversification, there is an important place for the study of phenotypic similarity across life forms. When similar phenotypes evolve independently in different lineages this is referred to as convergent evolution. Although long recognised, evolutionary convergence is receiving a resurgence of interest. This is in part because new genomic data sets allow detailed and tractable analysis of the genetic underpinnings of convergent phenotypes, and in part because of renewed recognition that convergence may reflect limitations in the diversification of life. In this review we propose that although convergent evolution itself does not require a new evolutionary framework, none the less there is room to generate a more systematic approach which will enable evaluation of the importance of convergent phenotypes in limiting the diversity of life's forms. We therefore propose that quantification of the frequency and strength of convergence, rather than simply identifying cases of convergence, should be considered central to its systematic comprehension. We provide a non-technical review of existing methods that could be used to measure evolutionary convergence, bringing together a wide range of methods. We then argue that quantification also requires clear specification of the level at which the phenotype is being considered, and argue that the most constrained examples of convergence show similarity both in function and in several layers of underlying form. Finally, we argue that the most important and impressive examples of convergence are those that pertain, in form and function, across a wide diversity of selective contexts as these persist in the likely presence of different selection pressures within the environment.},

ancestry. Constraints on biological materials and adaptation to 

particular habits or habitats 

will produce widespread convergence. How may we distinguish the 

two causes of resemblance? 

The relationship between convergence and taxonomy is discussed, 

demonstrating that the 

choice of taxonomic method will itself determine the extent to which 

convergence is perceived. 

In particular, cladistic analysis based on parsimony will tend to 

minimise and thus conceal 

convergence: neither the resulting cladogram nor a consistency 

index derived from it can be 

used to assess the prevalence of convergence. With any taxonomic 

system, there can be no 

substitute for evaluation of the morphological characters used. Complementary
 use of 

molecular characters shows promise: we wait further understanding 

of constraints in genetic 

evolution and of the possibilities of convergence at this level also.These general principles are illustrated with a range of examples 

from within and between 

invertebrate phyla: the phylogeny of Cnidaria and Platyhelminthes 

cannot be traced with 

certainty, but where the fossil record allows clear rooting, as for 

the echinoderms and in 

particular the echinoids, combination of morphological and molecular methods
 has made 

much progress. Sub-groups within a phylum, for example opisthobranch molluscs
 and the 

dipteran Phoridae, may show an uncontested phylogeny, and here studies
 have precisely 

identified convergence and shown that it may be the commoner cause of resemblance.
 

Adaptation to exacting environments shown by terrestial and freshwater
 

nemertines may also 

result in a predominance of convergent resemblance.Traditional grouping of phyla breaks down on re-examination of 

supposedly key characters, 

such as segmentation, body cavities, germ layers and symmetry, each of
 

which must have had 

multiple origins: nor are developmental stages (especially not 

larvae) a reliable guide to 

relationships. Demarcation of phyla may be difficult, as with 

arthropods, and location of phyla 

is even more difficult, due to their early and rapid radiation. 

Over-simplified definition of 

characters has bedevilled invertebrate classification and 

the use of molecular data has not yet 

resolved the major controversies.The question ‘How common is convergence?’ remains 

unanswered and may be 

unanswerable. Our examples indicate that even the minimum detectable 

levels of convergence 

are often high, and we conclude that at all levels convergence has 

been greatly underestimated.},

Empirical and theoretical studies show that including highly incomplete taxa can lead to multiple equally parsimonious trees, poorly resolved consensus trees, and decreased phylogenetic accuracy. However, the mechanisms that cause incomplete taxa to be problematic have remained unclear. It has been widely assumed that incomplete taxa are problematic because of the proportion or amount of missing data that they bear. In this study, I use simulations to show that the reduced accuracy associated with including incomplete taxa is caused by these taxa bearing too few complete characters rather than too many missing data cells. This seemingly subtle distinction has a number of important implications. First, the so-called missing data problem for incomplete taxa is, paradoxically, not directly related to their amount or proportion of missing data. Thus, the level of completeness alone should not guide the exclusion of taxa (contrary to common practice), and these results may explain why empirical studies have sometimes found little relationship between the completeness of a taxon and its impact on an analysis. These results also (1) suggest a more effective strategy for dealing with incomplete taxa, (2) call into question a justification of the controversial phylogenetic supertree approach, and (3) show the potential for the accurate phylogenetic placement of highly incomplete taxa, both when combining diverse data sets and when analyzing relationships of fossil taxa.},

	abstract = {Historical patterns of species diversity inferred from phylogenies typically contradict the direct evidence found in the fossil record. According to the fossil record, species frequently go extinct, and many clades experience periods of dramatic diversity loss. However, most analyses of molecular phylogenies fail to identify any periods of declining diversity, and they typically infer low levels of extinction. This striking inconsistency between phylogenies and fossils limits our understanding of macroevolution, and it undermines our confidence in phylogenetic inference. Here, we show that realistic extinction rates and diversity trajectories can be inferred from molecular phylogenies. To make this inference, we derive an analytic expression for the likelihood of a phylogeny that accommodates scenarios of declining diversity, time-variable rates, and incomplete sampling; we show that this likelihood expression reliably detects periods of diversity loss using simulation. We then study the cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), a group for which standard phylogenetic inferences are strikingly inconsistent with fossil data. When the cetacean phylogeny is considered as a whole, recently radiating clades, such as the Balaneopteridae, Delphinidae, Phocoenidae, and Ziphiidae, mask the signal of extinctions. However, when isolating these groups, we infer diversity dynamics that are consistent with the fossil record. These results reconcile molecular phylogenies with fossil data, and they suggest that most extant cetaceans arose from four recent radiations, with a few additional species arising from clades that have been in decline over the last ∼10 Myr.},

Combining data from the fossil record with molecular phylogenetics represents an exciting synthetic approach to this challenge. The first molecular divergence dating analysis (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1962) was based on a measure of the amino acid differences in the hemoglobin molecule, with replacement rates established (calibrated) using paleontological age estimates from textbooks (e.g., Dodson 1960). Since that time, the amount of molecular sequence data has increased dramatically, affording ever-greater opportunities to apply molecular divergence approaches to fundamental problems in evolutionary biology. To capitalize on these opportunities, increasingly sophisticated divergence dating methods have been, and continue to be, developed. In contrast, comparatively, little attention has been devoted to critically assessing the paleontological and associated geological data used in divergence dating analyses. The lack of rigorous protocols for assigning calibrations based on fossils raises serious questions about the credibility of divergence dating results (e.g., Shaul and Graur 2002; Brochu et al. 2004; Graur and Martin 2004; Hedges and Kumar 2004; Reisz and Müller 2004a, 2004b; Theodor 2004; van Tuinen and Hadly 2004a, 2004b; van Tuinen et al. 2004; Benton and Donoghue 2007; Donoghue and Benton 2007; Parham and Irmis 2008; Ksepka 2009; Benton et al. 2009; Heads 2011).},

In this article, we show through simulation that incorporation of fossil information dramatically improves our ability to distinguish among models of quantitative trait evolution using comparative data. We further suggest a novel Bayesian approach that allows fossil information to be integrated even when explicit phylogenetic hypotheses are lacking for extinct representatives of extant clades. By applying this approach to a comparative dataset comprising body sizes for caniform carnivorans, we show that incorporation of fossil information not only improves ancestral state estimates relative to those derived from extant taxa alone, but also results in preference of a model of evolution with trend toward large body size over alternative models such as Brownian motion or Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. Our approach highlights the importance of considering fossil information when making macroevolutionary inference, and provides a way to integrate the kind of sparse fossil information that is available to most evolutionary biologists.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, a new set of methods for estimating dated trees has emerged. Originally referred to as the fossilized birth–death (FBD) process, this single model has expanded to a family of models that allows researchers to coestimate evolutionary parameters (e.g., diversification, sampling) and patterns alongside divergence times for a variety of applications from paleobiology to real-time epidemiology. We provide an overview of this family of models. We explore the ways in which these models correspond to methods in quantitative paleobiology, as the FBD process provides a framework through which neontological and paleontological approaches to phylogenetics and macroevolution can be unified. We also provide an overview of challenges associated with applying FBD models, particularly with an eye toward the fossil record. We conclude this review by discussing several exciting avenues for the inclusion of fossil data in phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {The aim of macroevolutionary research is to understand pattern and process in phenotypic evolution and lineage diversification at and above the species level. Historically, this kind of research has been tackled separately by palaeontologists, using the fossil record, and by evolutionary biologists, using phylogenetic comparative methods. Although both approaches have strengths, researchers gain most power to understand macroevolution when data from living and fossil species are analysed together in a phylogenetic framework. This merger sets up a series of challenges – for many fossil clades, well-resolved phylogenies based on morphological data are not available, while placing fossils into phylogenies of extant taxa and determining their branching times is equally challenging. Once methods for building such trees are available, modelling phenotypic and lineage diversification using combined data presents its own set of challenges. The five papers in this Special Feature tackle a disparate range of topics in macroevolutionary research, from time calibration of trees to modelling phenotypic evolution. All are united, however, in implementing novel phylogenetic approaches to understand macroevolutionary pattern and process in or using the fossil record. This Special Feature highlights the benefits that may be reaped by integrating data from living and extinct species and, we hope, will spur further integrative work by empiricists and theoreticians from both sides of the macroevolutionary divide.},

	abstract = {Comparative sequence analyses on a collection of carefully chosen mammalian genomes could facilitate identification of functional elements within the human genome and allow quantification of evolutionary constraint at the single nucleotide level. High-resolution quantification would be informative for determining the distribution of important positions within functional elements and for evaluating the relative importance of nucleotide sites that carry single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Because the level of resolution in comparative sequence analyses is a direct function of sequence diversity, we propose that the information content of a candidate mammalian genome be defined as the sequence divergence it would add relative to already-sequenced genomes. We show that reliable estimates of genomic sequence divergence can be obtained from small genomic regions. On the basis of a multiple sequence alignment of ∼1.4 megabases each from eight mammals, we generate such estimates for five unsequenced mammals. Estimates of the neutral divergence in these data suggest that a small number of diverse mammalian genomes in addition to human, mouse, and rat would allow single nucleotide resolution in comparative sequence analyses.

	abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

	abstract = {The “tree of life” iconography, representing the history of life, dates from at least the latter half of the 18th century, but evolution as the mechanism providing this bifurcating history of life did not appear until the early 19th century. There was also a shift from the straight line, scala naturae view of change in nature to a more bifurcating or tree-like view. Throughout the 19th century authors presented tree-like diagrams, some regarding the Deity as the mechanism of change while others argued for evolution. Straight-line or anagenetic evolution and bifurcating or cladogenetic evolution are known in biology today, but are often misrepresented in popular culture, especially with anagenesis being confounded with scala naturae. Although well known in the mid 19th century, the geologist Edward Hitchcock has been forgotten as an early, if not the first author to publish a paleontologically based “tree of life” beginning in 1840 in the first edition of his popular general geology text Elementary Geology. At least 31 editions were published and those between 1840 and 1859 had this “paleontological chart” showing two trees, one for fossil and living plants and another for animals set within a context of geological time. Although the chart did not vary in later editions, the text explaining the chart did change to reflect newer ideas in paleontology and geology. Whereas Lamarck, Chambers, Bronn, Darwin, and Haeckel saw some form of transmutation as the mechanism that created their “trees of life,” Hitchcock, like his contemporaries Agassiz and Miller, who also produced “trees of life,” saw a deity as the agent of change. Through each edition of his book Hitchcock denounced the newer transmutationist hypotheses of Lamarck, then Chambers, and finally Darwin in an 1860 edition that no longer presented his tree-like “paleontological chart.”},

The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth.
Tree diagrams originated in the medieval era to represent genealogical relationships. Phylogenetic tree diagrams in the evolutionary sense date back to the mid-nineteenth century.
The term phylogeny for the evolutionary relationships of species through time was coined by Ernst Haeckel, who went further than Darwin in proposing phylogenic histories of life. In contemporary usage, tree of life refers to the compilation of comprehensive phylogenetic databases rooted at the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth. Two public databases for the tree of life are TimeTree, for phylogeny and divergence times, and the Open Tree of Life, for phylogeny.},

	abstract = {The meaning of any conception in the mind is the practical effect it will have in action. (Peirce 1878)The price of metaphor is eternal vigilance. (attributed to Rosenblueth and Wiener, Lewontin 2001)The tree of life (ToL) is used variously as metaphor, model, and research tool to explore life's evolution and genealogical relationships. It has broad appeal for multiple scientific communities and the public as a descriptive term covering life's diversity. However, as biologists identify more entities and events to describe—including species, organisms, cells, genomes, gene families, extra-chromosomal genetic elements, endosymbioses, hybridizations, recombination types, and lateral gene transfer (LGT) events—the ToL strains under the weight of multiple uses and expectations. The multiple uses span levels of biological organization, from genes to clades, and they extend to all life forms despite their disparate mechanisms of reproduction and inheritance. Furthermore, some biologists consider the purpose of the ToL to be communicating patterns of relationship, whereas others consider evolutionary process to be a primary focus (e.g., Woese 1998). Use of both metaphors (figures of speech) and models (diagrams) comparing evolution to branching trees go back at least to Darwin (1859). Current multiple uses of the ToL, despite their differences, share reliance on phylogenetic methods. The ToL works well as a strictly bifurcating tree in the absence of reticulate evolution, which results from hybridization, lineage merger, and LGT. However, for organisms where inheritance of traits is often reticulate, as with LGT in Bacteria and Archaea, the evolutionary histories of organismal lineages and their molecular traits can differ dramatically. As a result, identifiable histories for organismal lineages can fade or disappear entirely for lack of characters sharing that same history, complicating recognition, and tracking of species or other taxa. Similarly, the ToL applied to life's earliest evolution and origins is more specifically about molecular sequence lineages and their precursors than organismal lineages. For these reasons, the ToL has been criticized as disproven, obsolete, or restricted, applying to some life forms but not to others (e.g., Doolittle 1999; Bapteste et al. 2009; Puigbo et al. 2009). In this article, I argue for a pluralistic view of the ToL, not as a falsifiable hypothesis about the nature of the branching patterns, but as a broad metaphor for life's common descent, and as an ongoing effort to model genealogical relationships, such as reticulations, for molecular and organismal lineages. The ToL has also become an important heuristic device. This stems from its use in studying evolutionary process. I seek to show the heuristic value of ToL studies by discussing the mutually informing nature of phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary biology, including the impact of ToL studies on core concepts of species, genes, and homology. I suggest that both instrumentalist and realist philosophical approaches to systematics are applied in estimating the ToL. The expanding number of distinctive entities whose common descent with modification can be traced via phylogenetics (genes, genomes, cells, organisms, populations, and clades) requires a pluralistic approach if the ToL is to be useful in developing and integrating new knowledge about evolution. Although the overwhelming majority of the ToL's details are lost to time, much remains to be learned.},

	abstract = {There is near-universal acceptance that the way organisms are classified hierarchically into species, genera, tribes, families, orders, and so on should ideally describe a hierarchy of identity by descent from common ancestors. For example, a species compared with another in the same genus would be expected to have had a more recent common ancestor than that same species compared with another from a different genus. Perfectly understandably, however, there is a general reluctance to repeatedly revise previously accepted classifications unless there is a very good reason to do so. If a classification can be shown not to reflect a hierarchy of common ancestry then that would be accepted as a good reason for change: if a species in one genus had a more recent common ancestor with a species in another genus than it did with its supposed congeners, then biologists would revise their classification. Molecular systematics has revolutionized progress in identifying the most likely correct hierarchical classification. In contrast, the date of the most recent common ancestor of two organisms generally is not used to determine the level of the taxonomic hierarchy at which they are separated. The most recent common ancestor for two species in the same genus would have been earlier in some orders than the most recent common ancestor for two species separated at the family level in other orders. One reason for this apparent anomaly is that systematists who originally produced the hierarchical classifications in use today ranged along an axis from lumpers to splitters: the former were less keen to classify species with a particular degree of morphological similarity into different higher-level taxa than were the latter.},

An example is the alleged circularity involved in definitions of “homology” in terms of common ancestry. The gap between phylogeneticism and pheneticism is not as wide as many assume. Phylogeneticists are justified in maintaining that nonphenetic evidence may play an essential role in taxonomy (systematics). Pheneticists should allow such evidence to play a role at least in providing phylogenetic interpretations. The possibility remains that terms like “phenetic” will come to be used in so wide a sense that prevailing controversies are dissolved.

	abstract = {Phenetic clustering, the forming of hierarchical nonoverlapping groups strictly according to degree of similarity, has serious shortcoming as it is commonly used in biology. When used as a method for estimating phylogeny, phenetic clustering rests on a questionable assumption of correspodence between similarity and recency of common ancestry. This compromises its ability to reconstruct the correct branching sequence when rates of evolutionary divergence are unequal among lineages, as well as causing it to obscure rate differences even when the branching sequence is reconstructed correctly. When used as a method for analysing patterns of geographic variation and genetic continuity among populations, phenetic clustering rests on a questionable assumption of correspondence between similarity and degree of genetic continuity. This compromises its ability to identify genetically continuous units when their component populations are differentiated, and combined with its sensivity to uneven geographic sampling, it can cause the method to yield misleading results if sampling patterns are not taken into consideration. Finally, even when used simply as a method for analysing patterns of similarity without regard to causal processes, phenetic clustering rests on a questionable assumption of nested hierarchical structure. This compromises its ability to represent similarity relationships accurately when those relationships exhibit a significant nonhierarchical component. For all of the common biological applications of phenetic clustering, there exist alternative analytical methods that do not suffer from the problems associated with phenetic clustering. The problems in question result not from the phenetic (similarity) data themselves, which often can be analysed in more appropriate ways, but from the phenetic clustering procedure. At least some of the limitations of phenetic clustering as well as the advantages of alternative methods have been known for many years. Advocacy of phenetic clustering at the expense of more appropriate methods can be explained as the result of constraints imposed by an implicit assumption of nested hierarchies that was part of the taxonomic context within which the methods were developed.},

	abstract = {Phylogenomics is extremely powerful but introduces new challenges as no agreement exists on ‘standards’ for data selection, curation and tree inference. We use jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata) as a model to address these issues. Despite considerable efforts in resolving their evolutionary history and macroevolution, few studies have included a full phylogenetic diversity of gnathostomes, and some relationships remain controversial. We tested a new bioinformatic pipeline to assemble large and accurate phylogenomic datasets from RNA sequencing and found this phylotranscriptomic approach to be successful and highly cost-effective. Increased sequencing effort up to about 10 Gbp allows more genes to be recovered, but shallower sequencing (1.5 Gbp) is sufficient to obtain thousands of full-length orthologous transcripts. We reconstruct a robust and strongly supported timetree of jawed vertebrates using 7,189 nuclear genes from 100 taxa, including 23 new transcriptomes from previously unsampled key species. Gene jackknifing of genomic data corroborates the robustness of our tree and allows calculating genome-wide divergence times by overcoming gene sampling bias. Mitochondrial genomes prove insufficient to resolve the deepest relationships because of limited signal and among-lineage rate heterogeneity. Our analyses emphasize the importance of large, curated, nuclear datasets to increase the accuracy of phylogenomics and provide a reference framework for the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Slowdowns in lineage accumulation are often observed in phylogenies of extant species. One explanation is the presence of ecological limits to diversity and hence to diversification. Previous research has examined whether and how species richness (SR) impacts diversification rates, but rarely considered the evolutionary relatedness (ER) between species, although ER can affect the degree of interaction between species, which likely sets these limits. To understand the influences of ER on species diversification and the interplay between SR and ER, we present a simple birth–death model in which the speciation rate depends on the ER. We use different metrics of ER that operate at different scales, ranging from branch/lineage-specific to clade-wide scales. We find that the scales at which an effect of ER operates yield distinct patterns in various tree statistics. When ER operates across the whole tree, we observe smaller and more balanced trees, with speciation rates distributed more evenly across the tips than in scenarios with lineage-specific ER effects. Importantly, we find that negative SR dependence of speciation masks the impact of ER on some of the tree statistics. Our model allows diverse evolutionary trajectories for producing imbalanced trees, which are commonly observed in empirical phylogenies but have been challenging to replicate with earlier models.},

	abstract = {Conditional independence is a crucial notion in the development of probabilistic systems which are successfully employed in areas such as computer vision, computational biology, and natural language processing. We introduce a lattice-theoretic framework that permits the study of the conditional independence (CI) implication problem relative to the class of discrete probability measures. Semi-lattices are associated with CI statements and a finite, sound and complete inference system relative to semi-lattice inclusions is presented. This system is shown to be (1) sound and complete for inferring general from saturated CI statements and (2) complete for inferring general from general CI statements. We also show that the general probabilistic CI implication problem can be reduced to that for elementary CI statements. The completeness of the inference system together with its lattice-theoretic characterization yields a criterion we can use to falsify instances of the probabilistic CI implication problem as well as several heuristics that approximate this falsification criterion in polynomial time. We also propose a validation criterion based on representing constraints and sets of constraints as sparse 0–1 vectors which encode their semi-lattices. The validation algorithm works by finding solutions to a linear programming problem involving these vectors and matrices. We provide experimental results for this algorithm and show that it is more efficient than related approaches.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic metrics are essential tools used in the study of ecology, evolution and conservation. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) in particular is one of the most prominent measures of biodiversity and is based on the idea that biological features accumulate along the edges of phylogenetic trees that are summed. We argue that PD and many other phylogenetic biodiversity metrics fail to capture an essential process that we term attrition. Attrition is the gradual loss of features through causes other than extinction. Here we introduce “EvoHeritage”, a generalization of PD that is founded on the joint processes of accumulation and attrition of features. We argue that while PD measures evolutionary history, EvoHeritage is required to capture a more pertinent subset of evolutionary history including only components that have survived attrition. We show that EvoHeritage is not the same as PD on a tree with scaled edges; instead, accumulation and attrition interact in a more complex non-monophyletic way that cannot be captured by edge lengths alone. This leads us to speculate that the one-dimensional edge lengths of classic trees may be insufficiently flexible to capture the nuances of evolutionary processes. We derive a measure of EvoHeritage and show that it elegantly reproduces species richness and PD at opposite ends of a continuum based on the intensity of attrition. We demonstrate the utility of EvoHeritage in ecology as a predictor of community productivity compared with species richness and PD. We also show how EvoHeritage can quantify living fossils and resolve their associated controversy. We suggest how the existing calculus of PD-based metrics and other phylogenetic biodiversity metrics can and should be recast in terms of EvoHeritage accumulation and attrition.},

A generalized linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose novel ways of incorporating within-species variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of considering both continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative or "state") characters in the same analysis.},

However, maximum likelihood estimation methods (MLE) for inferring rates are limited to simpler models and can show bias, particularly in small phylogenies. Likelihood-free methods to estimate parameters of diversification models using deep learning have started to emerge, but how robust neural network methods are at handling the intricate nature of phylogenetic data remains an open question. Here we present a new ensemble neural network approach to estimate diversification parameters from phylogenetic trees that leverages different classes of neural networks (dense neural network, graph neural network, and long short-term memory recurrent network) and simultaneously learns from graph representations of phylogenies, their branching times and their summary statistics. Our best-performing ensemble neural network (which corrects graph neural network result using a recurrent neural network) can compute estimates faster than MLE and is less affected by tree size. Our analysis suggests that the primary limitation to accurate parameter estimation is the amount of information contained within a phylogeny, as indicated by its size and the strength of effects shaping it. In cases where MLE is unavailable, our neural network method provides a promising alternative for estimating phylogenetic tree parameters. If there are detectable phylogenetic signals present, our approach delivers results that are comparable to MLE but without inherent biases.},

	abstract = {It has been shown theoretically that sympatric speciation can occur if intraspecific competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. However, the plausibility of the involved processes is under debate, and many questions on the conditions for speciation remain unresolved. For instance, is strong disruptive selection sufficient for speciation? Which roles do genetic architecture and initial composition of the population play? How strong must assortative mating be before a population can split in two? These are some of the issues we address here. We investigate a diploid multilocus model of a quantitative trait that is under frequency‐dependent selection caused by a balance of intraspecific competition and frequency‐independent stabilizing selection. This trait also acts as mating character for assortment. It has been established previously that speciation can occur only if competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. We find that speciation becomes more difficult for very strong competition, because then extremely strong assortment is required. Thus, speciation is most likely for intermediate strengths of competition, where it requires strong, but not extremely strong, assortment. For this range of parameters, however, it is not obvious how assortment can evolve from low to high levels, because with moderately strong assortment less genetic variation is maintained than under weak or strong assortment sometimes none at all. In addition to the strength of frequency‐dependent competition and assortative mating, the roles of the number of loci, the distribution of allelic effects, the initial conditions, costs to being choosy, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the particular choice of the fitness function are explored. A multitude of possible evolutionary outcomes is observed, including loss of all genetic variation, splitting in two to five species, as well as very short and extremely long stable limit cycles. On the methodological side, we propose quantitative measures for deciding whether a given distribution reflects two (or more) reproductively isolated clusters.},

Although laboratory and field studies provide evidence that ‘ecological speciation’ can occur, our understanding of the details of the process is incomplete. Here we review ecological speciation by considering its constituent components: an ecological source of divergent selection, a form of reproductive isolation, and a genetic mechanism linking the two. Sources of divergent selection include differences in environment or niche, certain forms of sexual selection, and the ecological interaction of populations. We explore the evidence for the contribution of each to ecological speciation. Forms of reproductive isolation are diverse and we discuss the likelihood that each may be involved in ecological speciation. Divergent selection on genes affecting ecological traits can be transmitted directly (via pleiotropy) or indirectly (via linkage disequilibrium) to genes causing reproductive isolation and we explore the consequences of both. Along with these components, we also discuss the geography and the genetic basis of ecological speciation. Throughout, we provide examples from nature, critically evaluate their quality, and highlight areas where more work is required.},

Here I present a spatially resolved numerical hominin dispersal model (HDM) with empirically constrained key parameters that simulates the migration and interaction of Anatomically Modern Humans and Neanderthals in the rapidly varying climatic environment of the last ice age. The model simulations document that rapid temperature and vegetation changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events were not major drivers of global Neanderthal extinction between 50 and 35 thousand years ago, but played important roles regionally, in particular over northern Europe. According to a series of parameter sensitivity experiments conducted with the HDM, a realistic extinction of the Neanderthal population can only be simulated when Homo sapiens is chosen to be considerably more effective in exploiting scarce glacial food resources as compared to Neanderthals.},

Although many field experiments have shown effects of interspecific competition on abundance and reproduction1,3, there is no unequivocal experimental evidence that interspecific competition can influence rates of local extinction in the field. Here I report that in a long-term field experiment with artificial rockpools, interspecific competition between three common rock-pool zooplankton species led to increased local extinction rates. In addition, studies of the distributional dynamics of the species in natural rockpools also showed that interspecific competition increases extinction rates. These results imply that interspecific competition is likely to limit the regional richness of species in the rockpool metapopulation system. MacArthur and Wilson8 were the first to suggest that an increase in extinction rate per species with an increase in the number of species could influence species richness on islands. Moulton and Pimm9 found that this was so among birds introduced to the Hawaiian islands, but the present study is the first field experiment providing unequivocal evidence of the effect.},

We used four years of demographic data and seed-removal experiments to determine if introduced grasses caused elevated levels of seed consumption on native plant species in a coastal dune system in California, USA. We show that the endangered, coastal dune plant Lupinus tidestromii experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed consumption by the native rodent Peromyscus maniculatus due to its proximity to the invasive grass, Ammophila arenaria. We use stage-structured, stochastic population models to project that two of three study populations will decline toward extinction under ambient levels of consumption. For one of these declining populations, a relatively small decrease in consumption pressure should allow for persistence. We show that apparent competition with an invasive species significantly decreases the population growth rate and persistence of a native species. We expect that apparent competition is an important mechanism in other ecosystems because invasive plants often change habitat structure and plant–consumer interactions. Possible implications of the apparent-competition mechanism include selective extinction of species preferred by seed consumers in the presence of an invasive species and biological homogenization of communities toward non-preferred native plant species.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are believed to contain a wealth of information on diversification processes. However, comparing phylogenetic trees is not straightforward due to their high dimensionality. Researchers have therefore defined a wide range of low-dimensional summary statistics. Currently, it remains unexplored to what extent these summary statistics cover the same underlying information and what summary statistics best explain observed variation across phylogenies. Furthermore, a large subset of available summary statistics focusses on measuring the topological features of a phylogenetic tree, but are often only explored at the extreme edge cases of the fully balanced or imbalanced tree and not for trees of intermediate balance. Here, we introduce a new R package called ‘treestats’, that provides speed optimized code to compute 70 summary statistics. We study correlations between summary statistics on empirical trees and on trees simulated using several diversification models. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm to create intermediately balanced trees in a well-defined manner, in order to explore variation in summary statistics across a balance gradient. We find that almost all summary statistics are correlated with tree size, and find that it is difficult, if not impossible, to correct for tree size, unless the tree generating model is known. Furthermore, we find that across empirical and simulated trees, at least three large clusters of correlated summary statistics can be found, where statistics group together based on information used (topology or branching times). However, the finer grained correlation structure appears to depend strongly on either the taxonomic group studied (in empirical studies) or the tree generating model (in simulation studies). Amongst statistics describing the (im)balance of a tree, we find that almost all statistics vary non-linearly, and sometimes even non-monotonically, with our generated balance gradient. This indicates that balance is perhaps a more complex property of a tree than previously thought. Furthermore, using our new imbalancing algorithm, we devise a numerical test to identify balance statistics, and identify several statistics as balance statistics that were not previously considered as such. Lastly, our results lead to several recommendations on which statistics to select when analyzing and comparing phylogenetic trees.},

The new model presented here is a constant rate birth–death process with mass extinction and/or rate shift events at arbitrarily fixed times 1) before the present or 2) after the origin. The simulation approach for case (2) can also be used to simulate under more general models with fixed events after the origin. I use the developed simulation tools for showing that a mass extinction event cannot be distinguished from a model with constant speciation and extinction rates interrupted by a phase of stasis based on trees consisting of only extant species. However, once we distinguish between mass extinction and period of stasis based on paleontological data, fast simulations of trees with a fixed number of species allow inference of speciation and extinction rates using approximate Bayesian computation and allow for robustness analysis once maximum likelihood parameter estimations are available.},

Our method enables both model selection and estimation of epidemiological parameters from very large phylogenies. We demonstrate its speed and accuracy on simulated data, where it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. To illustrate its applicability, we assess the dynamics induced by superspreading individuals in an HIV dataset of men-having-sex-with-men in Zurich.

Their performances are compared in a simulation study and one is recommended for use as a result. A variety of other questions that may, in fact, be the questions of primary interest (e.g., Has the rate of cladogenesis been declining?) are then recast as biological variants of the purely statistical question—Is the birth process model appropriate for my data? Seen in this way, a preexisting arsenal of statistical techniques is opened up for use in this area: in particular, techniques developed for the analysis of Poisson processes and the analysis of survival data. These two approaches start from different representations of the data—the branch lengths in the tree—and I explicitly relate the two. Aiming for a synoptic account of useful theory in this area, I briefly discuss some important results from the analysis of two distinct birth-death processes: the one introduced into this area by Hey (1992) is refitted with some powerful statistical tools.},

However, this role remains comparatively unexplored on islands, which can include multiple independent clades resulting from different colonization events. To explore whether assuming no dependence on traits leads to bias in inference on island dynamics, we extend an island biodiversity model, DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Islands through Speciation, Immigration, and Extinction) to include trait-dependent diversification simulations, and evaluate the robustness of the inference model which ignores this trait-dependence. Our results indicate that when the differences between colonization, extinction, and speciation rates between trait states are moderate, the model shows negligible error for a variety of island diversity metrics, suggesting that island diversity dynamics can be accurately estimated without the need to explicitly model trait dependence. We conclude that for many biologically realistic scenarios with trait-dependent diversification and colonization, this simple trait-less inference model is informative and robust to trait effects on colonization, speciation, and extinction. Nonetheless, our new simulation model may provide a useful tool for studying patterns of trait variation.},

In this paper, I review the behavior and assumptions of the four most commonly used statistical criteria (Akaike's Information Criterion, AIC; Schwarz or Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC; Deviance Information Criterion, DIC; Bayes factors). Second, I illustrate differences in these model selection tools by applying the four criteria to thousands of simulated abundance trajectories. With the simulation model known, I examine whether each of the criteria are useful in selecting models to evaluate simple questions, such as whether time series support evidence of density dependent population growth. Across simulations, the maximum likelihood criteria consistently favored simpler population models when compared to Bayesian criteria. Among the Bayesian criteria, the Bayes factor favored the correct simulation model more frequently than the Deviance Information Criterion. There was considerable uncertainty in the ability of the Bayes factor to discriminate between models, this tool selected the simulation model slightly more frequently than other approaches.},

	abstract = {Tree-based paleobiological studies use inferred phylogenies as models to test hypotheses about macroevolution and the quality of the fossil record. Such studies raise two concerns. The first is how model trees might bias results. The second is testing hypotheses about parameters that affect tree inference.Bias introduced by model trees is explored for tree-based assessments of the quality of the fossil record. Several nuisance parameters affect tree-based metrics, including consistency of sampling probability, rates of speciation / extinction, patterns of speciation, applied taxonomic philosophy, and assumed taxonomy. The first two factors affect probabilistic assessments of sampling, but also can be tested and accommodated in sophisticated probability tests. However, the final three parameters (and the assumption of a correct phylogeny) do not affect probabilistic assessments.Often paleobiologists wish to test hypotheses such as rates of character change or rates of preservation. Assumptions about such parameters are necessary in simple phylogenetic methods, even if the assumptions are that rates are homogeneous or that sampling is irrelevant. Likelihood tests that evaluate phylogenies in light of stratigraphic data and / or alternative hypotheses of character evolution can reduce assumptions about unknowns by testing numerous unknowns simultaneously. Such tests have received numerous criticisms, largely based in philosophy. However, such criticisms are based on incorrect depictions of the logical structures of parsimony and likelihood, misunderstandings about when arguments are probabilistic (as opposed to Boolean), overly restrictive concepts of when data can test a hypothesis, and simply incorrect definitions of some terms.Likelihood methods can test multiparameter hypotheses about phylogeny and character evolution (i.e., rates, independence, etc.). The best hypothesis positing a single rate of independent character change (with no variation among character states) is determined for each topology. Hypotheses about rate variation among characters or across phylogeny, character independence, and different patterns of state evolution then are examined until one finds the simplest (i.e., fewest varying parameters) hypothesis that cannot be rejected given knowledge of a more complicated hypothesis. This is repeated for alternative topologies. An example is presented using hyaenids. Two trees are contrasted, one of which requires the minimum necessary steps and the other of which requires at least seven additional steps. Given either tree, likelihood rejects fewer than three general rates of character change and also rejects the hypothesis of independence among the characters. However, hypotheses of changes in rates across the tree do not add substantially to the tree likelihood. The likelihoods of the trees given stratigraphic data also are determined. Both morphologic and stratigraphic data suggest that the multiparameter hypothesis including the parsimony tree is significantly less likely than the multiparameter hypothesis including a different tree.},

Here, we reconstruct the temporal accumulation of terrestrial bird species of the Galápagos using a novel phylogenetic method that estimates rates of biota assembly for an entire community. We show that species richness on the archipelago is in an ascending phase and does not tend towards equilibrium. The majority of the avifauna diversifies at a slow rate, without detectable ecological limits. However, Darwin's finches form an exception: they rapidly reach a carrying capacity and subsequently follow a coalescent-like diversification process. Together, these results suggest that avian diversity of remote islands is rising, and challenge the mutual exclusivity of the non-equilibrium and equilibrium ecological paradigms.},

This will not only improve our understanding of diversification; it will also present a new perspective to the use of phylogenies in community ecology, the science of interaction networks and conservation biology, and might shift the current focus in ecology on equilibrium biodiversity theories to non-equilibrium theories recognising the crucial role of history.},

	abstract = {Motivation Genes which are involved in the same biological processes tend to co-evolve. Thus, metabolic pathways, protein complexes, and other kinds of protein-protein interactions can be inferred by looking for correlated patterns of gene retention and loss across the tree of life—a technique called phylogenetic profiling. Recent methodological developments on phylogenetic profiling have focused on scalability improvements to take advantage of the rapidly accumulating genomic data. However, state-of-the-art methods assume that the correlation resulting from co-evolving proteins is uniform across all species considered. This is reasonable for interactions already present at the root of the species considered, but less so for ones that emerge in more recent lineages. To address this challenge and take advantage of recent developments in deep learning methods, we introduce a phylogenetic profiling method which processes large gene co-phylogenies using neural networks.
Results We show that post-processing conventional phylogenetic profiles using deep neural networks can improve predictions, but requires onerous training on specific phylogenies. Overcoming this limitation by taking the topology of the species tree as an input, Graph Neural Networks are shown to outperform all other methods when interaction detection is not centered on just one species of interest, while also predicting when interactions appeared and in which taxa they are present.
Conclusion Graph Neural Networks constitute a promising new approach for phylogenetic profiling. Our work is a first foray into “dynamic phylogenetic profiling”—the reconstruction of pairwise protein interaction across time.

	abstract = {Deep Graph Networks (DGNs) currently dominate the research landscape of learning from graphs, due to their efficiency and ability to implement an adaptive message-passing scheme between the nodes. However, DGNs are typically limited in their ability to propagate and preserve long-term dependencies between nodes, i.e., they suffer from the over-squashing phenomena. As a result, we can expect them to under-perform, since different problems require to capture interactions at different (and possibly large) radii in order to be effectively solved. In this work, we present Anti-Symmetric Deep Graph Networks (A-DGNs), a framework for stable and non-dissipative DGN design, conceived through the lens of ordinary differential equations. We give theoretical proof that our method is stable and non-dissipative, leading to two key results: long-range information between nodes is preserved, and no gradient vanishing or explosion occurs in training. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that A-DGN yields to improved performance and enables to learn effectively even when dozens of layers are used.},

	abstract = {Paleontological completeness and stratigraphic ranges depend on extinction rate, origination rate, preservation rate, and the length of the interval of time over which observations can be made. I derive expressions for completeness and the distribution of durations and ranges as functions of these parameters, considering both continuous- and discrete-time models.Previous work has shown that, if stratigraphic ranges can be followed indefinitely forward, and if extinction and preservation occur at stochastically constant rates, then extinction rate and preservability can be estimated from (1) discrete (binned) stratigraphic ranges even if data on occurrences within ranges are unknown, and (2) continuous ranges if the number of occurrences within each range is known. I show that, regardless of whether the window of observation is finite or infinite, extinction and preservation rates can also be estimated from (3) continuous ranges when the number of occurrences is not known, and (4) discrete ranges when the number of occurrences is not known. One previous estimation method for binned data involves a sample-size bias. This is circumvented by using maximum likelihood parameter estimation. It is worth exploiting data on occurrences within ranges when these are available, since they allow preservation rate to be estimated with less variance. The various methods yield comparable parameter estimates when applied to Cambro-Ordovician trilobite species and Cenozoic mammal species.Stratigraphic gaps and variable preservation affect stratigraphic ranges predictably. In many cases, accurate parameter estimation is possible even in the face of these complications. The distribution of stratigraphic ranges can be used to estimate the sizes of gaps if their existence is known.},

	abstract = {Slowdowns in lineage accumulation in phylogenies suggest that speciation rates decline as diversity increases. Likelihood methods have been developed to detect such diversity dependence. However, a thorough test of whether such approaches correctly infer diversity dependence is lacking. Here, we simulate phylogenetic branching under linear negative diversity-dependent and diversity-independent models and estimate from the simulated phylogenies the maximum-likelihood parameters for three different conditionings – on survival of the birth–death process given the crown age, on tree size (N) and on tree size given the crown age. We report the accuracy of recovering the simulation parameters and the reliability of the model selection based on the χ2 likelihood ratio test. Parameter estimate accuracy: Conditioning on survival given the crown age yields a severe bias of the carrying capacity K towards N and an upward bias of the speciation rate, particularly in clades where diversity-dependent feedbacks are still weak (N « K). Conditioning on N yields an overestimate of K and an underestimate of speciation rate, particularly when saturation has been reached. Dual conditioning yields relatively unbiased parameter estimates on average, but the deviation from the true value for any single estimate may be large. Model selection reliability: The frequency of incorrectly rejecting a diversity-independent model when the simulation was diversity-independent (type I error) differs substantially from the significance level α used in the likelihood ratio test, rendering the likelihood ratio test inappropriate. The frequency of correctly rejecting the diversity-independent model when the simulation was diversity-dependent (power) is larger when the clade is closer to equilibrium and for conditioning on crown age. We conclude that conditioning on crown age has the best statistical properties overall, but caution that parameter estimates may be biased. To assess parameter uncertainty in future studies of diversity dependence on real data, we recommend parametric bootstrapping, examination of the likelihood surface and comparison of estimates across the types of conditioning. To assess model selection reliability, we discourage the use of the χ2 likelihood ratio test or AIC (which are equivalent in this case), but recommend a likelihood ratio test based on parametric bootstrap. We illustrate this method for the diversification of Dendroica warblers.},

Temporal declines in speciation rates have often been interpreted as the effect of ecological limits, competition, and diversity dependence, emphasising the role of biotic factors. Abiotic factors, such as climate change, are also supposed to have affected diversification rates over geological time scales, yet direct tests of these presumed effects have mainly been limited to few clades well represented in the fossil record. If warmer climatic periods have sustained faster speciation, this could explain slowdowns in speciation during the Cenozoic climate cooling. Here, we apply state-of-the art diversity-dependent and temperature-dependent phylogenetic models of diversification to 218 tetrapod families, along with constant rate and time-dependent models. We confirm the prevalence of diversification slowdowns, and find as much support for temperature-dependent than diversity-dependent models. These results call for a better integration of these two processes in studies of diversification dynamics.},

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have already been widely applied in various graph mining tasks. However, they suffer from the shallow architecture issue, which is the key impediment that hinders the model performance improvement. Although several relevant approaches have been proposed, none of the existing studies provides an in-depth understanding of the root causes of performance degradation in deep GNNs. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic experimental evaluation to present the fundamental limitations of shallow architectures. Based on the experimental results, we answer the following two essential questions: (1) what actually leads to the compromised performance of deep GNNs; (2) when we need and how to build deep GNNs. The answers to the above questions provide empirical insights and guidelines for researchers to design deep and well-performed GNNs. To show the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines, we present Deep Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron (DGMLP), a powerful approach (a paradigm in its own right) that helps guide deep GNN designs. Experimental results demonstrate three advantages of DGMLP: 1) high accuracy -- it achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance on various datasets; 2) high flexibility -- it can flexibly choose different propagation and transformation depths according to graph size and sparsity; 3) high scalability and efficiency -- it supports fast training on large-scale graphs.

	abstract = {We propose a recipe on how to build a general, powerful, scalable (GPS) graph Transformer with linear complexity and state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of benchmarks. Graph Transformers (GTs) have gained popularity in the field of graph representation learning with a variety of recent publications but they lack a common foundation about what constitutes a good positional or structural encoding, and what differentiates them. In this paper, we summarize the different types of encodings with a clearer definition and categorize them as being \${\textbackslash}textit\{local\}\$, \${\textbackslash}textit\{global\}\$ or \${\textbackslash}textit\{relative\}\$. The prior GTs are constrained to small graphs with a few hundred nodes, here we propose the first architecture with a complexity linear in the number of nodes and edges \$O(N+E)\$ by decoupling the local real-edge aggregation from the fully-connected Transformer. We argue that this decoupling does not negatively affect the expressivity, with our architecture being a universal function approximator on graphs. Our GPS recipe consists of choosing 3 main ingredients: (i) positional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii) global attention mechanism. We provide a modular framework \${\textbackslash}textit\{GraphGPS\}\$ that supports multiple types of encodings and that provides efficiency and scalability both in small and large graphs. We test our architecture on 16 benchmarks and show highly competitive results in all of them, show-casing the empirical benefits gained by the modularity and the combination of different strategies.},

Quantitative data on the postmortem behavior of organic remains in modern environments are providing new insights into death and fossil assemblages as sources of biological information. Important findings include: 1. With the exception of a few circumstances, usually recognizable by independent criteria, transport out of the original life habitat affects few individuals. 2. Most species with preservable hardparts are in fact represented in the local death assemblage, commonly in correct rank importance. Molluscs are the most durable of modern aquatic groups studied so far, and they show highest fidelity to the original community. 3. Time-averaging of remains from successive generations and communities often prevents the detection of short-term (seasons, years) variability but provides an excellent record of the natural range of community composition and structure over longer periods. Thus, although a complex array of processes and circumstances influences preservation, death assemblages of resistant skeletal elements are for many major groups good to excellent records of community composition, morphological variation, and environmental and geographic distribution of species, and such assemblages can record temporal dynamics at ecologically and evolutionarily meaningful scales.},

Diversification models have become increasingly complex over the past decade, and we have reached a point where the computation of the analytical likelihood of the model given a phylogeny is either unavailable or intractable. For such models, a likelihood-free approach such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) offers a solution. ABC is a Bayesian framework that uses one or more summary statistics instead of the likelihood function. Crucial to the performance of an ABC algorithm is the choice of summary statistics. Here, we analyse the applicability of three traditional and often-used summary statistics (Gamma statistic, Phylogenetic Diversity and tree size) within an ABC framework and propose a new summary statistic: the normalized Lineages-Through-Time (nLTT) statistic. We find that the traditional summary statistics perform poorly and should not be used as a substitute of the likelihood. By contrast, we find that the nLTT statistic performs on par with the likelihood. We suggest to include the nLTT statistic in future ABC applications within phylogenetics. We argue that the use of ABC in diversification rate analysis is a promising new approach, but that care should be taken which summary statistics are chosen.},

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

These predictions include both essential attributes of phylogenetic trees: lengths, in the form of internode distances; and topology, in the form of internode links. These models also lead directly to statistical tests which can be used to compare predictions with phylogenetic trees that are estimated from data.

	abstract = {Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks, from content recommendation to identifying protein functions. However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

	abstract = {Since the proposal of the graph neural network (GNN) by Gori et al. (2005) and Scarselli et al. (2008), one of the major problems in training GNNs was their struggle to propagate information between distant nodes in the graph. We propose a new explanation for this problem: GNNs are susceptible to a bottleneck when aggregating messages across a long path. This bottleneck causes the over-squashing of exponentially growing information into fixed-size vectors. As a result, GNNs fail to propagate messages originating from distant nodes and perform poorly when the prediction task depends on long-range interaction. In this paper, we highlight the inherent problem of over-squashing in GNNs: we demonstrate that the bottleneck hinders popular GNNs from fitting long-range signals in the training data; we further show that GNNs that absorb incoming edges equally, such as GCN and GIN, are more susceptible to over-squashing than GAT and GGNN; finally, we show that prior work, which extensively tuned GNN models of long-range problems, suffers from over-squashing, and that breaking the bottleneck improves their state-of-the-art results without any tuning or additional weights.

Current inference approaches typically rely on likelihood-based methods. These methods are not generalizable, as a new likelihood formula must be established each time a new model is proposed; for some models, such a formula is not even tractable. Deep learning can bring solutions in such situations, as deep neural networks can be trained to learn the relation between simulations and parameter values as a regression problem. In this paper, we adapt a recently developed deep learning method from pathogen phylodynamics to the case of diversification inference, and we extend its applicability to the case of the inference of state-dependent diversification models from phylogenies associated with trait data. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of the approach for the time-constant homogeneous BD model and the Binary-State Speciation and Extinction model. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed inference machinery by reanalyzing a phylogeny of primates and their associated ecological role as seed dispersers. Deep learning inference provides at least the same accuracy as likelihood-based inference while being faster by several orders of magnitude, offering a promising new inference approach for the deployment of future models in the field.},

Because extinction leaves a characteristic signature in the shape of molecular phylogenetic trees, many studies have used data from extant taxa only to infer extinction rates. This is a promising approach for the large number of taxa for which extinction rates cannot be estimated from the fossil record. Here, I explore the consequences of violating a common assumption made by studies of extinction from phylogenetic data. I show that when diversification rates vary among lineages, simple estimators based on the birth–death process are unable to recover true extinction rates. This is problematic for phylogenetic trees with complete taxon sampling as well as for the simpler case of clades with known age and species richness. Given the ubiquity of variation in diversification rates among lineages and clades, these results suggest that extinction rates should not be estimated in the absence of fossil data.},

Accurate estimation of speciation, extinction, and diversification rates is a prerequisite for gaining this insight. Here, we develop a stochastic birth–death model of speciation and extinction that predicts the probability distribution of both extinct and extant numbers of species in a clade. We present two estimation methods based on this model given data on the number of extinct species (from the fossil record) and extant species (from diversity assessments): a multivariate method of moments approach and a maximum-likelihood approach. We show that, except for some special cases, the two estimation methods produce very similar estimates. This is convenient, because the usually preferred maximum-likelihood approach is much more computationally demanding, so the method of moments can serve as a proxy. Furthermore, we introduce a correction for possible bias that can arise by the mere fact that we will normally only consider extant clades. We find that in some cases the bias correction affects the estimates profoundly. Finally, we show how our model can be extended to incorporate incomplete preservation. Preservation rates can, however, not be reliably estimated on the basis of numbers of extant and extinct species alone.},

More complicated models of evolutionary modes, such as branch-specific directional selection, have not been used because calculations of likelihood and parameter estimates in the maximum-likelihood framework are not straightforward. To solve this problem, we introduced a population genetics framework into a PCM, and here, we present a flexible and comprehensive framework for estimating evolutionary parameters through simulation-based likelihood computations. The method does not require analytic likelihood computations, and evolutionary models can be used as long as simulation is possible. Our approach has many advantages: it incorporates different evolutionary modes for phenotypes into phylogeny, it takes intraspecific variation into account, it evaluates full likelihood instead of using summary statistics, and it can be used to estimate ancestral traits. We present a successful application of the method to the evolution of brain size in primates. Our method can be easily implemented in more computationally effective frameworks such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which will enhance the use of computationally intensive methods in the study of phenotypic evolution.},

We find that strong competitive asymmetry, high resource levels, and intermediate harshness of the precompetitive environment favor coexistence of plants with different seed sizes. If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages.

Our primary goal in this work is to break this myopic view by (i) proposing a new benchmark suite for DNN training, called TBD1, which comprises a representative set of eight DNN models and covers six major machine learning applications: image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, object detection, adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and (ii) performing an extensive performance analysis of these models on three major deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, MXNet, CNTK) across different hardware configurations (single-GPU, multi-GPU, and multi-machine). We present a new toolchain for performance analysis for these models that combines the targeted usage of existing performance analysis tools, careful selection of performance metrics, and methodologies to analyze the results. We also build a new set of tools for memory profiling in three major frameworks. These tools can shed light on precisely how much memory is consumed by different data structures (weights, activations, gradients, workspace) in DNN training. Using our tools and methodologies, we make several important observations and recommendations on where future DNN training research and optimization should be focused.},

We investigated whether tree imbalance, a property that is commonly observed in phylogenetic trees, can lead to reduced accuracy or precision of phylogenetic timescale estimates. We analysed simulated data sets with calibrations at internal nodes and at the tips, taking into consideration different calibration schemes and levels of tree imbalance. We also investigated the effect of tree imbalance on two empirical data sets: mitogenomes from primates and serial samples of the African swine fever virus. In analyses calibrated using dated, heterochronous tips, we found that tree imbalance had a detrimental impact on precision and produced a bias in which the overall timescale was underestimated. A pronounced effect was observed in analyses with shallow calibrations. The greatest decreases in accuracy usually occurred in the age estimates for medium and deep nodes of the tree. In contrast, analyses calibrated at internal nodes did not display a reduction in estimation accuracy or precision due to tree imbalance. Our results suggest that molecular-clock analyses can be improved by increasing taxon sampling, with the specific aims of including deeper calibrations, breaking up long branches and reducing tree imbalance.},

To this aim, variation in speciation and extinction rates have been investigated through their signatures in the shapes of phylogenetic trees (Mooers and Heard, 1997). This issue is of great importance, as fitting stochastic models to tree data would help to understand underlying macroevolutionary processes. Although the prevailing view is that it does not represent phylogenies so well, the most popular model of phylogenetic trees is a branching process introduced by Yule, in which lineages split at random (Yule, 1924). Here we report the study of one major database of published phylogenies using the Yule model as well as several other models. Our results confirm the previous observation that the Yule model is inadequate to describe phylogenetic tree data. In addition, they support the hypothesis that many trees are consistent with a simple branch split model first considered by Aldous in 1996.},

I tried Mooers's (1995) method to correct for tree size, but his measure appeared to become dependent on tree size when there are large trees (i.e., 14 tips) in a collection. Instead I corrected for tree size by taking the difference between Colless's index of observed trees and the ERM model expectation for a tree of the same size. The balance measure thus obtained did not correlate significantly to consistency and retention indices as indicators of data quality. It was also independent of the factors kingdom (plants and animals) and taxon level at the tips and type of data (molecular, morphological, and combined).},

	abstract = {Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are one of the most popular GNN architectures and are considered as the state-of-the-art architecture for representation learning with graphs. In GAT, every node attends to its neighbors given its own representation as the query. However, in this paper we show that GAT computes a very limited kind of attention: the ranking of the attention scores is unconditioned on the query node. We formally define this restricted kind of attention as static attention and distinguish it from a strictly more expressive dynamic attention. Because GATs use a static attention mechanism, there are simple graph problems that GAT cannot express: in a controlled problem, we show that static attention hinders GAT from even fitting the training data. To remove this limitation, we introduce a simple fix by modifying the order of operations and propose GATv2: a dynamic graph attention variant that is strictly more expressive than GAT. We perform an extensive evaluation and show that GATv2 outperforms GAT across 11 OGB and other benchmarks while we match their parametric costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/tech-srl/how\_attentive\_are\_gats . GATv2 is available as part of the PyTorch Geometric library, the Deep Graph Library, and the TensorFlow GNN library.},

Despite their success, one severe limitation of GNNs is the over-smoothing issue (indistinguishable representations of nodes in different classes). In this work, we present a systematic and quantitative study on the over-smoothing issue of GNNs. First, we introduce two quantitative metrics, MAD and MADGap, to measure the smoothness and over-smoothness of the graph nodes representations, respectively. Then, we verify that smoothing is the nature of GNNs and the critical factor leading to over-smoothness is the low information-to-noise ratio of the message received by the nodes, which is partially determined by the graph topology. Finally, we propose two methods to alleviate the over-smoothing issue from the topological view: (1) MADReg which adds a MADGap-based regularizer to the training objective; (2) AdaEdge which optimizes the graph topology based on the model predictions. Extensive experiments on 7 widely-used graph datasets with 10 typical GNN models show that the two proposed methods are effective for relieving the over-smoothing issue, thus improving the performance of various GNN models.},

	abstract = {While the theory of micro-evolution by natural selection assigns a crucial role to competition, its role in macroevolution is less clear. Phylogenetic evidence for a decelerating accumulation of lineages suggests a feedback of lineage diversity on diversification. However, does this feedback only occur between close relatives, or do distant relatives also influence each other’s diversification? In other words: are there phylogenetic limits to this diversity-dependence? Islands form ideal systems to answer these questions because their boundedness facilitates an overview of all potential competitors. The DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Island biota through Speciation Immigration and Extinction) framework allows for testing the presence of diversity-dependence on islands given phylogenetic data on colonization and branching times. The current inference models in DAISIE assume that this diversity-dependence only applies within a colonizing clade, i.e., all mainland species can colonize and diversify independently from one another. We term this clade-specific (CS) diversity-dependence. Here we introduce a new DAISIE model that assumes that diversity-dependence applies to all island species of a taxonomic group regardless of their mainland ancestry, i.e., diversity-dependence applies both to species within the same clade and between different clades established by different mainland species. We call this island-wide (IW) diversity-dependence. We present a method to compute a likelihood for this model given phylogenetic data on colonization and branching events and use likelihood ratio bootstrapping to compare it to the likelihood of the CS model in order to overcome biases known for standard model selection. We apply it to the diversification of Eleutherodactylus frogs on Hispaniola. Across the Greater Antilles archipelago, this radiation shows repeated patterns of diversification in ecotypes that are similar across clades. This could be suggestive of overlapping niche space and hence between-clade interactions, i.e., IW diversity-dependence. But it could also be suggestive of only within-clade interactions because between-clade interactions would have blocked the same ecotype from re-appearing. We find that the CS model fits the data much better than the IW model, indicating that different colonizations while resulting in similar ecotypes, are sufficiently distinct to avoid interacting strongly. We argue that non-overlapping distributions between clades (both spatially and in terms of ecotypes) cannot be used as evidence of CS diversity-dependence, because this pattern may be a consequence of IW diversity-dependence. By contrast, by using phylogenetic data rather than distributional data our method does allow for inferring the phylogenetic limits to diversity-dependent diversification. We discuss possibilities for future extensions and applications of our modelling approach.

This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. We show the competitiveness of our model compared to other available methods using nine metagenomic datasets of moderate size for binary classification. With synthetic and biological datasets, we show the superior and robust performance of our model for multi-class classification.

	abstract = {To infer the processes that gave rise to past speciation and extinction rates across taxa, space and time, we often formulate hypotheses in the form of stochastic diversification models and estimate their parameters from extant phylogenies using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, however, likelihoods can easily become intractable, limiting our ability to consider more complicated diversification processes. Recently, it has been proposed that deep learning (DL) could be used in this case as a likelihood-free inference technique. Here, we explore this idea in more detail, with a particular focus on understanding the ideal network architecture and data representation for using DL in phylogenetic inference. We evaluate the performance of different neural network architectures (DNN, CNN, RNN, GNN) and phylogeny representations (summary statistics, Lineage Through Time or LTT, phylogeny encoding and phylogeny graph) for inferring rates of the Constant Rate Birth-Death (CRBD) and the Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BISSE) models. We find that deep learning methods can reach similar or even higher accuracy than Maximum Likelihood Estimation, provided that network architectures and phylogeny representations are appropriately tuned to the respective model. For example, for the CRBD model we find that CNNs and RNNs fed with LTTs outperform other combinations of network architecture and phylogeny representation, presumably because the LTT is a sufficient and therefore less redundant statistic for homogenous BD models. For the more complex BiSSE model, however, it was necessary to feed the network with both topology and tip states information to reach acceptable performance. Overall, our results suggest that deep learning provides a promising alternative for phylogenetic inference, but that data representation and architecture have strong effects on the inferential performance.},

Darwin's view of gradual, anagenetic evolution has been widely adopted by evolutionary biologists although paleontologists have repeatedly pointed out that several fossil records suggest a different pattern; of rapid evolution when a species appears, followed by morphological stasis during its subsequent lifetime (Eldredge and Gould 1972; Gould and Eldredge 1993; Stanley 1998).},

	abstract = {Time-calibrated molecular phylogenies provide a valuable window into the tempo and mode of species diversification, especially for the large number of groups that lack adequate fossil records. Molecular phylogenetic data frequently suggest an initial “explosive speciation” phase, leading to widespread speculation that ecological niche-filling processes might govern the dynamics of species diversification during evolutionary radiations. However, these patterns are difficult to reconcile with the fossil record. The fossil record strongly suggests that extinction rates have been high relative to speciation rates, but such elevated background extinction should erase the signal of early, rapid speciation from molecular phylogenies. For this reason, extinction rates in molecular phylogenies are frequently estimated as zero under the widely used birth–death model. Here, I construct a simple model that combines phylogenetically patterned extinction with pulsed turnover dynamics and constant diversity through time. Using approximate Bayesian methods, I show that heritable extinction can easily explain the phenomenon of explosive early diversification, even when net diversification rates are equal to zero. Several assumptions of the model are more consistent with both the fossil record and neontological data than the standard birth–death model and it may thus represent a viable alternative interpretation of phylogenetic diversification patterns. These results suggest that variation in the absolute rate of lineage turnover through time, in conjunction with phylogenetically nonrandom extinction, may underlie the apparent diversity-dependent speciation observed in molecular phylogenies.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

However, this model assumes that new species arise instantaneously as singletons and consequently makes unrealistic predictions about species lifetimes, speciation rates and number of rare species. Here, we resolve these anomalies – without compromising any of the original model's existing achievements and retaining computational and analytical tractability – by modelling speciation as a gradual, protracted, process rather than an instantaneous event. Our model also makes new predictions about the diversity of ‘incipient’ species and rare species in the metacommunity. We show that it is both necessary and straightforward to incorporate protracted speciation in future studies of neutral models, and argue that non-neutral models should also model speciation as a gradual process rather than an instantaneous one.},

The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to light-weight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer \$h\_\{n - 1\}\$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ to get the raw scores \$o\_\{i\}\$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores \$o\_\{i\}\$ by \$0\$, i.e. \$f(o) = {\textbackslash}max(0, o\_\{i\})\$, where \$f(o)\$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions \${\textbackslash}hat\{y\}\$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax \$f(x)\$.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Slowdowns in lineage accumulation are often observed in phylogenies of extant species. One explanation for this is the presence of ecological limits to diversity and hence to diversification. Previous research has examined whether and how species richness (SR) impacts diversification rates, but rarely considered the evolutionary relatedness (ER) between species, even though phylogenetic distance can play a role in the degree of competition between species, which likely sets these ecological limits. To understand the influence of ecological limits represented by ER on species diversification, and to investigate the interplay between SR and ER effects on diversification, we present a new phylogenetic birth-death model in which the speciation rate depends on the ER between species. We use different metrics of ER that operate at different scales, from lineage-specific to clade-wide. We find that the different scales of ER effect yield distinct patterns in speciation rates and various tree statistics. When ER operates across the whole tree, we observe smaller and more balanced phylogenetic trees, with internal nodes concentrated more closely to the root and speciation rates distributed more evenly across the tips than in scenarios with lineage-specific ER effects. Importantly, we find that the presence of negative SR dependence can reduce the influence of ER on some of the tree statistics. This suggests that these tree statistics should not be used to detect an effect of evolutionary relatedness on clade diversification.},

While Pareto defines efficiency in terms of the maximal utilities of the individuals (i.e., the definition currently adopted by economic literature), he introduces a first-order condition for efficiency which refers to the definition of efficiency in terms of minimal resources. The equivalent surplus maximization implied by Pareto's explanation of this condition is incorrect (although it leads to the correct first-order condition), whereas the maximization of distributable surplus applies, as shown by Allais. The two notions of efficiency are analyzed in a general global framework including externalities, and their equivalence is demonstrated under weak assumptions of monotonicity between utilities and resources.},

However, current GNN methods are inherently flat and do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs---a limitation that is especially problematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict the label associated with an entire graph. Here we propose DiffPool, a differentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical representations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network architectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool yields an average improvement of 5-10\% accuracy on graph classification benchmarks, compared to all existing pooling approaches, achieving a new state-of-the-art on four out of five benchmark datasets.},

This study evaluates the effectiveness of two well-known transformation methods: linear transformation and statistical standardization. These two are referred to as data standardization. A carefully designed experiment is used in which data from two-group classification problems were trained by feedforward networks. Different kinds of classification problems, from relatively simple to hard, were generated. Other experimental factors include network architecture, sample size, and sample proportion of group 1 members. Three performance measurements for the effect of data standardization are employed. The results suggest that networks trained on standardized data yield better results in general, but the advantage diminishes as network and sample size become large. In other words, neural networks exhibit a self-scaling capability. In addition, impact of data standardization on the performance of training algorithm in terms of computation time and number of iterations is evaluated. The results indicate that, overall, data standardization slows down training. Finally, these results are illustrated with a data set obtained from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.},

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks.

	volume = {282},
	abstract = {The competition-relatedness hypothesis (CRH) predicts that the strength of competition is the strongest among closely related species and decreases as species become less related. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that common ancestry causes close relatives to share biological traits that lead to greater ecological similarity. Although intuitively appealing, the extent to which phylogeny can predict competition and co-occurrence among species has only recently been rigorously tested, with mixed results. When studies have failed to support the CRH, critics have pointed out at least three limitations: (i) the use of data poor phylogenies that provide inaccurate estimates of species relatedness, (ii) the use of inappropriate statistical models that fail to detect relationships between relatedness and species interactions amidst nonlinearities and heteroskedastic variances, and (iii) overly simplified laboratory conditions that fail to allow eco-evolutionary relationships to emerge. Here, we address these limitations and find they do not explain why evolutionary relatedness fails to predict the strength of species interactions or probabilities of coexistence among freshwater green algae. First, we construct a new data-rich, transcriptome-based phylogeny of common freshwater green algae that are commonly cultured and used for laboratory experiments. Using this new phylogeny, we re-analyse ecological data from three previously published laboratory experiments. After accounting for the possibility of nonlinearities and heterogeneity of variances across levels of relatedness, we find no relationship between phylogenetic distance and ecological traits. In addition, we show that communities of North American green algae are randomly composed with respect to their evolutionary relationships in 99\% of 1077 lakes spanning the continental United States. Together, these analyses result in one of the most comprehensive case studies of how evolutionary history influences species interactions and community assembly in both natural and experimental systems. Our results challenge the generality of the CRH and suggest it may be time to re-evaluate the validity and assumptions of this hypothesis.},

Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and community structure.

	abstract = {Studies of diversification patterns often find a slowing in lineage accumulation toward the present. This seemingly pervasive pattern of rate downturns has been taken as evidence for adaptive radiations, density-dependent regulation, and metacommunity species interactions. The significance of rate downturns is evaluated with statistical tests (the γ statistic and Monte Carlo constant rates (MCCR) test; birth–death likelihood models and Akaike Information Criterion [AIC] scores) that rely on null distributions, which assume that the included species are a random sample of the entire clade. Sampling in real phylogenies, however, often is nonrandom because systematists try to include early-diverging species or representatives of previous intrataxon classifications. We studied the effects of biased sampling, structured sampling, and random sampling by experimentally pruning simulated trees (60 and 150 species) as well as a completely sampled empirical tree (58 species) and then applying the γ statistic/MCCR test and birth–death likelihood models/AIC scores to assess rate changes. For trees with random species sampling, the true model (i.e., the one fitting the complete phylogenies) could be inferred in most cases. Oversampling deep nodes, however, strongly biases inferences toward downturns, with simulations of structured and biased sampling suggesting that this occurs when sampling percentages drop below 80\%. The magnitude of the effect and the sensitivity of diversification rate models is such that a useful rule of thumb may be not to infer rate downturns from real trees unless they have \&gt;80\% species sampling.},

To evaluate this, in an empirical study different graph representations of the acquired test data were set up. On these, four different state-of-the-art GNN architectures were trained and compared on the task of raw sensitivity prediction for a MEMS gyroscope. Whereas the GNNs performed on par with a light gradient boosting machine, neural network and multivariate adaptive regression splines model used as baseline on the complete data set, in the presence of sparse data, the GNNs outperformed the baseline methods in terms of the overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) and achieved distinct improvement in the maximum error when trained on data with similar sparsity rates as observed during the validation.},

	abstract = {Recent speciation research has generally focused on how lineages that originate in allopatry evolve intrinsic reproductive isolation, or how ecological divergence promotes nonallopatric speciation. However, the ecological basis of allopatric isolation, which underlies the most common geographic mode of speciation, remains poorly understood and largely unstudied. Here, we explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that promote speciation in Desmognathus and Plethodon salamanders from temperate eastern North America. Based on published molecular phylogenetic estimates and the degree of geographic range overlap among extant species, we find strong evidence for a role for geographic isolation in speciation. We then examine the relationship between climatic variation and speciation in 16 sister-taxon pairs using geographic information system maps of climatic variables, new methods for modeling species' potential geographic distributions, and data on geographic patterns of genetic variation. In contrast to recent studies in tropical montane regions, we found no evidence for parapatric speciation along climatic gradients. Instead, many montane sister taxa in the Appalachian Highlands inhabit similar climatic niches and seemingly are allopatric because they are unable to tolerate the climatic conditions in the intervening lowlands. This temporal and spatial-ecological pattern suggests that niche conservatism, rather than niche divergence, plays the primary role in promoting allopatric speciation and montane endemism in this species-rich group of vertebrates. Our results demonstrate that even the relatively subtle climatic differences between montane and lowland habitats in eastern North America may play a key role in the origin of new species.},

	abstract = {The assumption of an ecological limit to the number of species in a given region is frequently invoked in evolutionary studies, yet its empirical basis is remarkably meager. We explore this assumption by integrating data on geographical distributions and phylogenetic relationships of nearly six thousand terrestrial vertebrate species. In particular, we test whether sympatry with closely-related species leads to decreasing speciation rates. We introduce the concept of clade density, which is the sum of the areas of overlap between a given species and other members of its higher taxon, weighted by their phylogenetic distance. Our results showed that, regardless of the chosen taxon and uncertainty in the phylogenetic relationships between the studied species, there is no significant relationship between clade density and speciation rate. We argue that the mechanistic foundation of diversity-dependent diversification is fragile, and that a better understanding of the mechanisms driving regional species pools is sorely needed.},

I suggest that it is the tendency of lineages to maintain their ancestral ecological niche (phylogenetic niche conservatism) and their failure to adapt to new environments which frequently isolates incipient species and begins the process of speciation. Niche conservatism may be an important and widespread component of allopatric speciation but is largely unstudied. The perspective outlined here suggests roles for key microevolutionary processes (i.e., natural selection, adaptation) that are strikingly different from those proposed in previous literature on ecology and speciation. Yet, this perspective is complementary to the traditional view because it focuses on a different temporal stage of the speciation process.},

	issn = {1469-185X},
	abstract = {Phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) typically refers to the tendency of closely related species to be more similar to each other in terms of niche than they are to more distant relatives. This has been implicated as a potential driving force in speciation and other species-richness patterns, such as latitudinal gradients. However, PNC has not been very well defined in most previous studies. Is it a pattern or a process? What are the underlying endogenous (e.g. genetic) and exogenous (e.g. ecological) factors that cause niches to be conserved? What degree of similarity is necessary to qualify as PNC? Is it possible for the evolutionary processes causing niches to be conserved to also result in niche divergence in different habitats? Here, we revisit these questions, codifying a theoretical and operational definition of PNC as a mechanistic evolutionary process resulting from several factors. We frame this both from a macroevolutionary and population-genetic perspective. We discuss how different axes of physical (e.g. geographic) and environmental (e.g. climatic) heterogeneity interact with the fundamental process of PNC to produce different outcomes of ecological speciation. We also review tests for PNC, and suggest ways that these could be improved or better utilized in future studies. Ultimately, PNC as a process has a well-defined mechanistic basis in organisms, and future studies investigating ecological speciation would be well served to consider this, and frame hypothesis testing in terms of the processes and expected patterns described herein. The process of PNC may lead to patterns where niches are conserved (more similar than expected), constrained (divergent within a limited subset of available niches), or divergent (less similar than expected), based on degree of phylogenetic relatedness between species.},

	abstract = {One of the primary goals of macroevolutionary biology has been to explain general trends in long-term diversity patterns, including whether such patterns correspond to an upscaling of processes occurring at lower scales. Reconstructed phylogenies often show decelerated lineage accumulation over time. This pattern has often been interpreted as the result of diversity-dependent (DD) diversification, where the accumulation of species causes diversification to decrease through niche filling. However, other processes can also produce such a slowdown, including time dependence without diversity dependence. To test whether phylogenetic branching patterns can be used to distinguish these two mechanisms, we formulated a time-dependent, but diversity-independent model that matches the expected diversity through time of a DD model. We simulated phylogenies under each model and studied how well likelihood methods could recover the true diversification mode. Standard model selection criteria always recovered diversity dependence, even when it was not present. We correct for this bias by using a bootstrap method and find that neither model is decisively supported. This implies that the branching pattern of reconstructed trees contains insufficient information to detect the presence or absence of diversity dependence. We advocate that tests encompassing additional data, for example, traits or range distributions, are needed to evaluate how diversity drives macroevolutionary trends.},

Here, we empirically test this gambit using data on ecologically relevant traits from {\textgreater}15,000 vertebrate species. Specifically, we estimate a measure of surrogacy of PD for FD. We find that maximizing PD results in an average gain of 18\% of FD relative to random choice. However, this average gain obscures the fact that in over one-third of the comparisons, maximum PD sets contain less FD than randomly chosen sets of species. These results suggest that, while maximizing PD protection can help to protect FD, it represents a risky conservation strategy.},

Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

Here we argue that empirical evidence supports a model whereby ecological factors associated with resource availability regulate species richness at continental scales. Any large-scale predictive model for biological diversity must explain three robust patterns in the natural world. First, species richness for evolutionary biotas is highly correlated with resource-associated surrogate variables, including area, temperature, and productivity. Second, species richness across epochal timescales is largely stationary in time. Third, the dynamics of diversity exhibit clear and predictable responses to mass extinctions, key innovations, and other perturbations. Collectively, these patterns are readily explained by a model in which species richness is regulated by diversity-dependent feedback mechanisms. We argue that many purported tests of the ecological limits hypothesis, including branching patterns in molecular phylogenies, are inherently weak and distract from these three core patterns. We have much to learn about the complex hierarchy of processes by which local ecological interactions lead to diversity dependence at the continental scale, but the empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that they do.},

This has substantial consequences for the interpretation of many studies that have contrasted rates of diversification among clades and regions. Often, it is possible to estimate the total diversification experienced by a clade but not diversification rate itself.

One hypothesis about competition’s contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

Such tests require measures of balance or imbalance and the moments or probability distributions of these measures under some null models. In earlier work, I developed recursion equations for the mean, variance, skewness, and complete probability distribution of Colless's coefficient of imbalance (I) (Rogers, 1994, Evolution 48:2026–2036). In this paper, I report the extension of these techniques to two additional imbalance measures, the number of unbalanced nodes on a tree (J) and Sackin's index (K), under both the equal-rates Markov (ERM) model and the equal probability (EP) model. I also show how to find the correlations and joint probability distributions of all pairs of these three coefficients. I and K are so highly correlated for trees of all sizes that K contains little additional information about tree balance that is not conveyed by I. The correlation of I and J, however, decreases rapidly with increasing tree size, indicating that the testing of macroevolutionary hypotheses may be refined by employing the joint distribution of these two coefficients. The results of two simulation studies of non-ERM speciation processes are used to illustrate how the joint distribution of I and J may be used},

Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass‐corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade.

	abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif’s Cmean and Pagel’s λ performed well and substantially better than Moran’s I and Blomberg’s K. Pagel’s λ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif’s Cmean. Blomberg’s K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.},

	abstract = {To evaluate rates of evolution, to establish tests of correlation between two traits, or to investigate to what degree the phylogeny of a species assemblage is predictive of a trait value so-called tests for phylogenetic signal are used. Being based on different approaches, these tests are generally thought to possess quite different statistical performances. In this article, we show that the Blomberg et al. K and K*, the Abouheif index, the Moran's I, and the Mantel correlation are all based on a cross-product statistic, and are thus all related to each other when they are associated to a permutation test of phylogenetic signal. What changes is only the way phylogenetic and trait similarities (or dissimilarities) among the tips of a phylogeny are computed. The definitions of the phylogenetic and trait-based (dis)similarities among tips thus determines the performance of the tests. We shortly discuss the biological and statistical consequences (in terms of power and type I error of the tests) of the observed relatedness among the statistics that allow tests for phylogenetic signal. Blomberg et al. K* statistic appears as one on the most efficient approaches to test for phylogenetic signal. When branch lengths are not available or not accurate, Abouheif's Cmean statistic is a powerful alternative to K*.},
